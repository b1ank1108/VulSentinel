## Vulnerability
SolarWinds Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP for Windows before 15.2.3 HF2 contain a remote memory escape vulnerability that leads to remote code execution. A remote attacker can send crafted memory operations to gain privileged access on the affected system, potentially resulting in full system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first checks if port 22 is open, then uses the nuclei SSH library to connect in information mode and retrieve server details. It parses the banner to confirm the "SSH-2.0-Serv-U" signature, extracts the version via regex from `SSH-2.0-Serv-U_(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)(?:\.(\d+))?`, and applies a DSL matcher with `compare_versions(version, ' < 15.2.3.742')`. This is passive version enumeration only.
