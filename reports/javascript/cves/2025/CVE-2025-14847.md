## Vulnerability
MongoDB Server is affected by CVE-2025-14847 (MongoBleed), an information disclosure flaw in the wire protocol. Mismatched length fields in Zlib-compressed protocol headers allow an unauthenticated client to read uninitialized heap memory. Impact includes potential exposure of sensitive in-memory data such as field names, internal strings, and heap contents. Remediation requires updating to 7.0.28, 8.0.17, 8.2.3, 6.0.27, 5.0.32, 4.4.30 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template uses a JavaScript flow (with TCP fallback) that first verifies the port is open, then connects to TCP/27017 and sends crafted MongoDB wire protocol packets containing a static Zlib-compressed payload with intentional length mismatches to trigger heap over-read. It reads the full response, extracts raw payload after message length/opcode parsing, and scans for leaked data using byte-pattern matching for strings like "field name '", "type ", "InvalidBSON", "bson length", and any printable ASCII sequences >=10 characters (excluding known error/OK strings). If leaks are found (or raw response >50 bytes with error markers), it reports. The TCP probe sends a hex-encoded buildInfo command to admin.$cmd, confirms MongoDB response via "version" + "maxBsonObjectSize" words, extracts version with regex, and applies OR-ed compare_versions DSL matchers to flag vulnerable ranges.
