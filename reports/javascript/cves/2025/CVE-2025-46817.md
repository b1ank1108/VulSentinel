## Vulnerability
Redis is an open-source, in-memory database that persists on disk. CVE-2025-46817 allows an authenticated user to submit a specially crafted Lua script causing an integer overflow, which can lead to remote code execution. The flaw exists in all versions with Lua scripting enabled and is fixed in 8.2.2. Impact includes full system compromise by authenticated attackers.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template executes a two-step JavaScript flow on TCP port 6379. Step 1 preconditions on port openness, calls `redis.GetServerInfo` to extract `redis_version` via regex and matches `success == true && compare_versions(version, ' <= 8.2.1')`. Step 2 calls `redis.RunLuaScript` with password payloads (including empty string) and benign payload `return "lua enabled"`, matching `success == true && contains(response, 'lua enabled')` (internal) to confirm Lua scripting is enabled and functional.
