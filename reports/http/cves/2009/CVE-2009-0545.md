## Vulnerability
ZeroShell 1.0beta11 and earlier is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution via cgi-bin/kerbynet. The NoAuthREQ x509List action fails to sanitize shell metacharacters in the `type` parameter, allowing arbitrary command execution.  
Impact: remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with full system privileges.  
CVSS: 10.0 (CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)  
Remediation: upgrade to a patched version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/cgi-bin/kerbynet?Section=NoAuthREQ&Action=x509List&type=*%22;/root/kerbynet.cgi/scripts/getkey%20../../../etc/passwd;%22`, injecting a command that reads `/etc/passwd`. It matches the response body with the regex `root:.*:0:0:` to confirm successful command execution and privileged file access.
