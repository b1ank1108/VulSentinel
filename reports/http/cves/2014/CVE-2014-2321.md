## Vulnerability
ZTE F460 and F660 cable modems expose an unauthenticated web shell endpoint at `/web_shell_cmd.gch`. Remote attackers can send arbitrary `sendcmd` requests to obtain administrative access, for example by issuing `set TelnetCfg` commands that enable TELNET with attacker-specified credentials.  

**Impact:** Remote code execution (full administrative control).  
**CVSSv2:** 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)  
**CWE:** CWE-264  
**Remediation:** Apply the latest firmware update provided by ZTE.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/web_shell_cmd.gch` and verifies the presence of the web-shell interface via two exact strings in the response body ("please input shell command" AND "ZTE Corporation. All rights reserved") together with HTTP 200 status. This fingerprints the vulnerable endpoint that, when present, permits direct command execution without credentials or further interaction.
