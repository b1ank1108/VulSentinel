## Vulnerability
A cross-site scripting vulnerability in webadmin/policy/group_table_ajax.php/ in Netsweeper before 3.1.10, 4.0.x before 4.0.9, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the PATH_INFO.

CVSS v3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')  
CPE: cpe:2.3:a:netsweeper:netsweeper:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the targeted user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

Apply the latest security patches or updates provided by the vendor to mitigate this vulnerability.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/webadmin/policy/group_table_ajax.php/%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`, embedding the XSS payload directly in the PATH_INFO. Detection succeeds when the response body contains the exact unsanitized payload string, the headers include webadminU= or webadmin= cookies (or condition), Content-Type contains text/html, and status code is 200.
