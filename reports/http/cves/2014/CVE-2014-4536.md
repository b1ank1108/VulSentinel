## Vulnerability
Infusionsoft Gravity Forms Add-on for WordPress contains multiple reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-4536) in `tests/notAuto_test_ContactService_pauseCampaign.php`. Remote unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `go`, `contactId`, or `campaignId` query parameters.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1), CWE-79. Impact includes client-side script execution leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement. Fixed by upgrading to 1.5.7 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first fingerprints the plugin by requesting `/wp-content/plugins/infusionsoft/readme.txt` and internally matching for the words "Infusionsoft" and "Tags:" (case-insensitive). It then sends a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with XSS payloads encoded in the three parameters and confirms successful reflection by matching the unsanitized string `"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the response body together with `text/html` Content-Type and HTTP 200 status.
