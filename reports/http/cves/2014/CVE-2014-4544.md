## Vulnerability
Podcast Channels WordPress plugin versions before 0.28 are vulnerable to an unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via the `Filename` parameter in `getid3/demos/demo.write.php`.

Description: The Podcast Channels WordPress plugin was affected by an unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting security vulnerability.

CVSS: 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) | CWE-79.

Impact: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected website, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

Remediation: Update to the latest version of the Podcast Channels plugin (0.28 or higher).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/podcast-channels/getid3/demos/demo.write.php` with a crafted `Filename` query parameter containing the reflected XSS payload `Filename' ></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. It verifies the flaw by checking whether the exact unsanitized payload string appears in the response body, the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
