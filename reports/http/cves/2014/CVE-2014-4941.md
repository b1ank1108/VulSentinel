## Vulnerability
Absolute path traversal (LFI) in Cross-RSS (wp-cross-rss) 1.7 WordPress plugin. Unauthenticated remote attackers can read arbitrary files by supplying a full pathname in the `rss` parameter to `/wp-content/plugins/cross-rss/proxy.php`.

CVSSv2: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)  
CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory  
Impact: Exposure of sensitive server files (e.g., configuration, credentials).  
Remediation: Update plugin to fixed version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues `GET /` and internally matches `contains(body, "/wp-content/plugins/cross-rss/") && status_code == 200` to confirm plugin presence. It then issues `GET /wp-content/plugins/cross-rss/proxy.php?rss=/etc/passwd` and matches regex `root:.*:0:0:` in body with status 200 to verify successful arbitrary file read.
