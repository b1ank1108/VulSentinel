## Vulnerability
WP Planet WordPress plugin (vendor czepol) versions 0.1 and earlier contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in `rss.class/scripts/magpie_debug.php`. The `url` GET parameter is unsanitized and reflected directly into the HTML response, allowing remote unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.  
CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) · CWE-79 · EPSS 0.03802 (87.86th percentile).  
Impact: victim browser script execution (session hijacking, defacement). No server-side code execution, data modification, or authentication bypass.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only  
The template verifies the vulnerable condition with two unauthenticated GET requests:  
1. `/wp-content/plugins//wp-planet/readme.txt` – matches word “WP Planet” in body to confirm plugin presence.  
2. `/wp-content/plugins/wp-planet/rss.class/scripts/magpie_debug.php?url=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` – checks that the exact payload string appears unencoded in response body, Content-Type contains `text/html`, and status is 200.  
No credentials, no state change, no out-of-band interaction; purely passive reflection test confirming missing output encoding.
