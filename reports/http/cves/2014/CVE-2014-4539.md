## Vulnerability
Cross-site scripting (XSS) in Movies plugin <= 0.6 for WordPress. Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `filename` parameter to `/wp-content/plugins/movies/getid3/demos/demo.mimeonly.php`.

Successful exploitation executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context (requires social engineering to visit crafted link), enabling session hijacking, page defacement, or theft of sensitive information (e.g., cookies).

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)  
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first fingerprints the installed plugin by issuing `GET /wp-content/plugins/movies/readme.txt` and internally matching for the strings "Movies =" and "Tags:". It then sends `GET {{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/movies/getid3/demos/demo.mimeonly.php?filename=filename%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&` and verifies the reflected payload in the response body, `text/html` Content-Type header, and HTTP 200 status.
