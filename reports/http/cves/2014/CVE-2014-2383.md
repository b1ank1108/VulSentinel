## Vulnerability
Dompdf before 0.6.1 is vulnerable to local file inclusion in `dompdf.php` when `DOMPDF_ENABLE_PHP` is enabled. Context-dependent attackers can bypass chroot protections and read arbitrary files by injecting PHP stream wrappers (e.g., `php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=`) into the `input_file` parameter.

Impact: unauthorized access to sensitive files (configuration, credentials, source code), potential remote code execution, and full system compromise. The flaw is commonly exposed through direct installs or bundled copies in WordPress plugins (e.g., web-portal-lite-client-portal, buddypress-component-stats, post-pdf-export).

CVSS v2: 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) | CWE-200

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues unauthenticated GET requests (stop-at-first-match) to 11 common `dompdf.php` locations—including root, library, and multiple WordPress plugin paths—using the payload `?input_file=php://filter/resource=/etc/passwd`. Success is confirmed by HTTP 200, `Content-Type: application/pdf` plus `filename="dompdf_out.pdf"` header, and regex match for `/etc/passwd` content (`root:[x*]:0:0`).
