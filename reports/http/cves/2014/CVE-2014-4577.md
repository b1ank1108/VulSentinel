## Vulnerability
Absolute path traversal (CWE-22) in `reviews.php` of the WP AmASIN – The Amazon Affiliate Shop WordPress plugin (0.9.6 and earlier) allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a full pathname supplied in the `url` parameter.  
CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N (score 5.0).  
Impact: exposure of configuration files, database credentials, and sensitive system files, potentially enabling full site compromise.  
Remediation: update to 0.9.7 or later or remove the plugin.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template uses a two-step flow. First, it issues `GET /` and applies an internal matcher to confirm plugin presence via `contains(body, "/wp-content/plugins/wp-amasin-the-amazon-affiliate-shop/") && status_code == 200`. Second, it issues `GET /wp-content/plugins/wp-amasin-the-amazon-affiliate-shop/reviews.php?url=/etc/passwd` and verifies exploitation success with status 200 and regex `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body.
