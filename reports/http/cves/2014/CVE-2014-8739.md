## Vulnerability

CVE-2014-8739 is an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the jQuery File Upload Plugin 6.4.4, specifically in `server/php/UploadHandler.php`. This vulnerability affects the Creative Contact Form (formerly Sexy Contact Form) plugin for WordPress (versions before 1.0.0) and Joomla! (versions before 2.0.1). The vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary PHP files without authentication or validation, then execute them by directly accessing the uploaded file in the `files/` directory. This was actively exploited in the wild in October 2014.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating critical severity. The EPSS score of 0.91552 (99.66th percentile) demonstrates extremely high exploitation probability in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template performs a two-step verification process to detect this vulnerability:

1. **File Upload**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-content/plugins/sexy-contact-form/includes/fileupload/index.php` with a multipart form containing a PHP file. The uploaded file contains a simple PHP echo statement with a random marker string. The template verifies successful upload by checking for HTTP 200 status, presence of "files" and "delete_url" in the response body, and a "text/plain" content type.

2. **Code Execution Verification**: Sends a GET request to access the uploaded PHP file at `/wp-content/plugins/sexy-contact-form/includes/fileupload/files/{{fname}}.php`. The template confirms successful remote code execution by checking if the response contains the random marker string that was embedded in the uploaded PHP file.

The template uses random filenames and markers to avoid false positives and ensure the uploaded file is actually executed.
