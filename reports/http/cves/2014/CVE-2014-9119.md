## Vulnerability
WordPress DB Backup plugin <=4.5 (and possibly prior) contains a local file inclusion flaw in `download.php` via unsanitized `file` parameter. Unauthenticated remote attackers can read arbitrary server files (e.g. `wp-config.php` exposing DB_NAME/DB_PASSWORD).  
Impact: sensitive file disclosure aiding further attacks.  
Remediation: update to 4.6+.  
CVSS v2: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N). CWE-22. CPE: cpe:2.3:a:db_backup_project:db_backup:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/db-backup/download.php?file=../../../wp-config.php`, then matches for HTTP 200 status plus both `DB_NAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` strings in the response body to confirm successful path-traversal file read.
