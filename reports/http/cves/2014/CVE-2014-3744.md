## Vulnerability
A directory traversal vulnerability in the st module before 0.2.5 for Node.js allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a %2e%2e (encoded dot dot) sequence in the request path. This results in unauthorized file disclosure, such as /etc/passwd.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5), CWE-22.

Impact: An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive information.

Remediation: Upgrade to a patched version of the st module or use an alternative module that is not vulnerable to directory traversal.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd` (multiple encoded `../` traversals from a presumed public static-serve path) and verifies success by matching regex `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body together with HTTP status 200.
