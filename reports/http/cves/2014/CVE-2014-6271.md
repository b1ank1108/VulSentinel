cve_id: CVE-2014-6271
template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2014/CVE-2014-6271.yaml
affected_product: GNU Bash
severity: critical
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: through 4.3
preconditions: CGI-enabled web server (e.g. Apache mod_cgi/mod_cgid with Bash interpreter)
poc_classification: rce

## Vulnerability
GNU Bash through version 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in environment variable values, enabling remote arbitrary code execution. Vectors include mod_cgi/mod_cgid in Apache HTTP Server, OpenSSH ForceCommand, DHCP clients, and any scenario where environment variables are set across a privilege boundary from Bash execution (aka ShellShock, CVE-2014-6271).  
**Impact:** Remote code execution can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and system compromise.  
**Remediation:** Apply the necessary patches and updates provided by the vendor to fix the vulnerability.  
**CVSS:** 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE:** 78

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues unauthenticated GET requests to common CGI paths (`/`, `/cgi-bin/status`, `/cgi-bin/stats`, `/cgi-bin/test`, `/cgi-bin/status/status.cgi`, `/test.cgi`, `/debug.cgi`, `/cgi-bin/test-cgi`, `/cgi-bin/test.cgi`) and injects the ShellShock payload `() { ignored; }; echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ; /bin/cat /etc/passwd ` into the `Shellshock`, `Referer`, and `Cookie` headers. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 status combined with regex match `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body, confirming command execution.
