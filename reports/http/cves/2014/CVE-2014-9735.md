## Vulnerability
The ThemePunch Slider Revolution (revslider) plugin before 3.0.96 for WordPress and Showbiz Pro plugin 1.7.1 and earlier do not properly restrict access to administrator AJAX functionality. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to (1) upload and execute arbitrary PHP files via `update_plugin`, (2) delete arbitrary sliders via `delete_slider`, and (3) create, update, import or export arbitrary sliders.  
CVSS 2.0: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) • CWE-264 • Unaffected WordPress instances with the plugin installed are vulnerable to full server compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template performs active RCE validation:  
1. POSTs a multipart/form-data request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=revslider_ajax_action` and `client_action=update_plugin`, embedding a randomly-named ZIP containing a PHP webshell that echoes a base64-encoded random marker.  
2. Asserts HTTP 200 and presence of “Update in progress...” plus redirect to the sliders page.  
3. Issues a follow-up GET to `/wp-content/plugins/revslider/temp/update_extract/{{random}}.php` and confirms the marker string is returned, proving arbitrary PHP execution succeeded.
