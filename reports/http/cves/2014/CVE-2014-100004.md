## Vulnerability
Sitecore CMS contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability via the "special way" of displaying XML Controls directly, which allows for a Cross Site Scripting Attack.  
Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, credentials, or performing actions on behalf of users.  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1) • CWE-79 • CPE: cpe:2.3:a:sitecore:sitecore.net:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*  
Remediation: Update to a patched version of Sitecore CMS or apply vendor security updates.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/?xmlcontrol=body%20onload=alert(document.domain)`. It then matches on the exact unsanitized payload string `<body onload=alert(document.domain) />` appearing in the response body, combined with a `text/html` Content-Type header and HTTP 200 status, confirming that user-controlled input reaches the page without escaping and can therefore be used to exfiltrate data such as session cookies or credentials via injected JavaScript.
