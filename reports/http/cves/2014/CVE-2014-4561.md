## Vulnerability
Ultimate Weather Plugin <= 1.0 for WordPress contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The flaw is present in the plugin's output handling, allowing injection of malicious scripts. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1, CWE-79). Successful exploitation enables execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser or theft of sensitive information such as session cookies.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first internally requests `/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-weather-plugin/readme.txt` and matches for the strings 'Ultimate Weather' and 'Tags:' to confirm plugin presence. It then issues a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-weather-plugin/magpierss/scripts/magpie_debug.php?url=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` and verifies the exact injected payload appears unescaped in the response body, along with HTTP status 200 and `text/html` content-type.
