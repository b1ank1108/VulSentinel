## Vulnerability

Eyou E-Mail before 3.6 is vulnerable to remote code execution (CVE-2014-1203, CWE-77) via injection of shell metacharacters into user-controlled parameters, allowing arbitrary command execution as demonstrated in the template via the `type` parameter.

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/webadm/?q=moni_detail.do&action=gragh` containing the command injection payload `type='|cat /etc/passwd||'`. It verifies exploitation by matching for Unix root user details (`root:.*:0:0:`) in the HTTP 200 response body.
