## Vulnerability
WordPress Duplicator plugin before 0.4.5 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `files/installer.cleanup.php`. Remote unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML by supplying a malicious `package` parameter.

CVSS 2.0: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N). CWE-79.

Successful exploitation allows session hijacking, page defacement for visitors, or theft of sensitive browser-stored data such as cookies or form values.

Remediation: Upgrade to Duplicator 0.4.5 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-step detection flow. First it silently fetches `/wp-content/plugins/duplicator/readme.txt` and confirms the string "Duplicator - WordPress Migration" (internal matcher) to verify the target runs the vulnerable plugin. Second it sends a crafted GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/duplicator/files/installer.cleanup.php?remove=1&package=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and asserts that the exact unsanitized payload appears in the response body, the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, and the status is 200. This confirms the `package` parameter is reflected without HTML escaping.
