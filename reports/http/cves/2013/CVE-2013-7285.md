## Vulnerability
XStream API versions before 1.4.6 and 1.4.10 allow unauthenticated remote code execution. When the security framework is not initialized, an attacker can supply a crafted XML (or supported format) input stream that triggers unsafe deserialization, enabling arbitrary shell command execution. This leads to sensitive data exposure, data modification, or full system control (CVSS 9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template sends one unauthenticated POST request to `/` containing a `sorted-set` XML payload with a `dynamic-proxy` → `EventHandler` → `ProcessBuilder` gadget that executes `curl http://{{interactsh-url}}`. Detection occurs via OAST: the interactsh matcher confirms an incoming HTTP callback carrying the `User-Agent: curl` header from the target.
