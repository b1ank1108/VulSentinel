## Vulnerability
The WordPress Traffic Analyzer plugin suffers from a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `js/ta_loaded.js.php`. Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the unsanitized `aoid` parameter.

This affects possibly version 3.3.2 and earlier. CVSS 4.3 (medium) per CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N (CWE-79).

Exploitation can lead to malicious script execution in users' browsers, enabling theft of sensitive information (e.g., cookies) or unauthorized client-side actions.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first fetches the plugin's readme.txt file to confirm installation (matching "traffic analy" and "Tags:" internally). It then issues a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with a proof-of-concept payload `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the `aoid` parameter. Detection succeeds if the payload is reflected verbatim in the HTML response body (status 200, text/html content-type).

This confirms the reflected XSS flaw.
