## Vulnerability
WordPress Plugin Uploader 1.0.4 contains multiple reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in `views/notify.php`. Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `notify` or `blog` parameters.

CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N (score 4.3) | CWE-79 | CPE cpe:2.3:a:roberta_bramski:uploader:1.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Successful exploitation allows injection of malicious scripts, enabling data theft (e.g., session cookies), session hijacking, or page defacement for victims who follow crafted links.

Remediation: Update to the latest version of the Uploader plugin or apply the vendor-supplied patch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first fetches `/wp-content/plugins/uploader/readme.txt` and internally matches for the strings 'Uploader' and 'Tags:' to confirm plugin presence. It then issues a GET to `/wp-content/plugins/uploader/views/notify.php?notify=unnotif&blog=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`, verifying the exact unsanitized payload appears in the response body, status is 200, and Content-Type is text/html.
