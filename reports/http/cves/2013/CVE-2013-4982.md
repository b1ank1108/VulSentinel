## Vulnerability
AVTECH DVR products are vulnerable to login verification code bypass (CVE-2013-4982, CWE-287). Supplying the `login=quick` parameter to the `/cgi-bin/nobody/VerifyCode.cgi` endpoint allows attackers to skip the verification code check during login attempts using base64-encoded `username:password` credentials.  
**CVSS v2 score:** 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)  
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the DVR system, enabling viewing of camera feeds, modification of settings, or full device compromise.  
**Remediation:** Update to latest firmware or contact vendor for security patch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects the bypass by issuing a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/cgi-bin/nobody/VerifyCode.cgi?account={{base64(username + ':' + password)}}&login=quick` via pitchfork attack with payloads `username: admin` and `password: linux321`. It matches on an `and` condition: regex `^0.*\nOK.*` in the response body, HTTP status code exactly 200, and response body length exactly 5 bytes, confirming successful verification-code bypass.
