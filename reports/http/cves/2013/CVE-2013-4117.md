## Vulnerability
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in `includes/CatGridPost.php` of the Category Grid View Gallery WordPress plugin 2.3.1. Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the unsanitized `ID` GET parameter.

CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N (score 4.3)  
CWE-79  
Successful exploitation enables session hijacking, page defacement, or theft of sensitive information such as cookies or user data.  
Remediation: update to the latest patched version of the plugin.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues an internal request to `/wp-content/plugins/category-grid-view-gallery/readme.txt` and silently matches the string "Category Grid View Gallery =" to confirm plugin presence. It then sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/category-grid-view-gallery/includes/CatGridPost.php?ID=1</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. Detection succeeds when the response body contains the exact unsanitized payload string, the status code is 200, and the Content-Type header contains "text/html".
