## Vulnerability
IceWarp Mail Server versions prior to 11.1.1 contains a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in the `/webmail/old/calendar/minimizer/index.php` endpoint. The flaw is triggered via the `script` or `style` GET parameters, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the server filesystem (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5).  
Impact includes unauthorized access to sensitive configuration files, credentials, or source code, enabling further attacks such as credential theft or lateral movement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template performs two unauthenticated GET requests:  
`{{BaseURL}}/webmail/old/calendar/minimizer/index.php?script=...%2f.%2f...%2f.%2f...%2f.%2f...%2f.%2f...%2f.%2f...%2f.%2f...%2f.%2f...%2f.%2f...%2f.%2f...%2f.%2f...%2f.%2fetc%2fpasswd`  
and the equivalent using the `style` parameter.  
It matches on HTTP 200 status and the regex `root:[x*]:0:0` appearing in the response body, confirming successful traversal and leakage of `/etc/passwd`.
