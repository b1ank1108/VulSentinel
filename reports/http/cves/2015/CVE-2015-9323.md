## Vulnerability
Authenticated blind (time-based) SQL injection vulnerability in the 404 to 301 – Redirect, Log and Notify 404 Errors WordPress plugin versions <= 2.0.2. The issue lies in insufficient sanitization of the `orderby` parameter on the admin logs page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=i4t3-logs`).

Impact: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or potential compromise of the WordPress site. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Fixed in version 2.0.3.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a POST to `/wp-login.php` with `log={{username}}&pwd={{password}}` to authenticate, then issues a GET to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=i4t3-logs&orderby=(SELECT * FROM (SELECT SLEEP(7))XXX)--+-`. It detects the vulnerability if response duration >= 7 seconds (confirming time-based blind SQLi), status_code == 200, content-type contains "text/html", and body contains "404-to-301".
