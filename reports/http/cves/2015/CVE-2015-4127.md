template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2015/CVE-2015-4127.yaml
affected_product: WordPress Church Admin plugin
severity: medium
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: <0.810
preconditions: Church Admin plugin installed on a WordPress site
poc_classification: info-leak
---

## Vulnerability
WordPress Church Admin plugin before 0.810 suffers from reflected cross-site scripting (XSS). Remote unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `id` parameter to `/wp-content/plugins/church-admin/includes/validate.php` (original report also references the `address` parameter on the church_admin-registration-form endpoint).

**CVSS v2**: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)  
**CWE**: 79  
**Impact**: Injected scripts execute in the victim's browser context when the page is viewed, enabling session token theft, data exfiltration, or arbitrary client-side actions on the affected WordPress site.  
**Remediation**: Update the Church Admin plugin to version 0.810 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs an internal GET to `/wp-content/plugins/church-admin/readme.txt` and matches the string "Church Admin =" to fingerprint plugin presence. It then sends a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/church-admin/includes/validate.php?id=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies the exact payload is reflected unsanitized in the response body, the Content-Type header contains "text/html", and the status is 200.
