## Vulnerability
Geddy prior to version 13.0.8 contains a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in `lib/app/index.js` that allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a `..%2f` (dot dot encoded slash) sequence in the PATH_INFO to the default URI.

CVSSv2: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N). Impact includes reading sensitive files like configuration or password files.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request with a deep path traversal payload (`/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd`) to the application root and checks for HTTP 200 status along with the regex match `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body to confirm LFI success.
