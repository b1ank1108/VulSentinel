## Vulnerability
WordPress ShowBiz Pro plugin <= 1.7.1 contains an unauthenticated arbitrary PHP file upload via the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint using the `showbiz_ajax_action` with `client_action=update_plugin`. A ZIP archive containing a PHP file is accepted, extracted to `/wp-content/plugins/showbizpro/temp/update_extract/`, and immediately executable, resulting in full remote code execution.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type).  
Impact: complete server compromise and data breach.  
Remediation: remove or disable the plugin immediately.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template uploads a benign ZIP containing a PHP file that echoes a random marker string via a single unauthenticated multipart/form-data POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`, then issues a follow-up GET to the extracted file path to confirm marker presence in the response body (status 200 required for both steps). No login, cookies, or credentials are sent; detection relies solely on successful upload + execution of the test payload.
