## Vulnerability
WordPress MyPixs plugin versions 0.3 and prior contains a local file inclusion vulnerability in `mypixs/downloadpage.php` via the `url` parameter. Unauthenticated remote attackers can include and read arbitrary local files on the server (e.g. /etc/passwd), leading to sensitive data exposure.

## PoC / Detection
