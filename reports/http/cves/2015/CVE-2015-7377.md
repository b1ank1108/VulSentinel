## Vulnerability
WordPress Pie-Register plugin before 2.0.19 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in `pie-register/pie-register.php`. Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `invitaion_code` parameter on the pie-register page at the default URL.

Successful exploitation could lead to execution of arbitrary script code in the context of the affected website, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.

Remediation: Update to version 2.0.19 or higher.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/?page=pie-register&show_dash_widget=1&invitaion_code=PC9zY3JpcHQ+PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4pPC9zY3JpcHQ+` (decoded payload: `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`). It verifies the vulnerability if the unsanitized payload appears in the response body, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and the status is 200.
