## Vulnerability
Joomla! versions 1.5.x, 2.x, and 3.x prior to 3.4.6 are affected by an unauthenticated PHP object injection vulnerability via the HTTP User-Agent header. Remote attackers can inject malicious serialized objects (exploited in the wild December 2015) to achieve arbitrary PHP code execution and full server compromise.

**Impact**: Complete server compromise through RCE, potential data breach.  
**Remediation**: Update to Joomla 3.4.6 or later immediately.  
**CVSS**: 7.5 (CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs two HTTP GET requests to `/`:  
1. Baseline request that internally fingerprints Joomla presence (contains "Joomla", status 200).  
2. Exploit request injecting a crafted User-Agent header with a serialized `JDatabaseDriverMysqli` + `SimplePie` object chain that forces `assert(phpinfo();JFactory::getConfig();exit;)`.  

Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 responses containing both "PHP Extension" and "PHP Version" strings, confirming successful arbitrary code execution and PHP environment disclosure.
