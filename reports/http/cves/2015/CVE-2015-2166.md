## Vulnerability
Ericsson Drutt Mobile Service Delivery Platform (MSDP) versions 4, 5, and 6 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a ..%2f (dot dot encoded slash) sequence in the default URI of the Instance Monitor (CWE-22 path traversal).  
Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure.  
Remediation: Apply the latest security patches or updates provided by the vendor to fix the LFI vulnerability in the Ericsson Drutt MSDP application.  
Classification: CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N (score 5.0).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd` and detects successful LFI if the response status code is 200 and the body matches the regex `root:.*:0:0:` (confirming /etc/passwd contents were returned).
