## Vulnerability
HTTP.sys in Microsoft Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted HTTP requests (malformed Range header triggering integer overflow/range parsing flaw), aka "HTTP.sys Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."  
CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C (score 10.0), CWE-94.  
Attackers can execute arbitrary code remotely on Windows servers running vulnerable HTTP.sys, potentially leading to complete system compromise and data breach.  
Remediation: Apply Microsoft security update MS15-034 immediately.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` with header `Range: bytes=0-18446744073709551615`. It matches on AND condition: response body contains both "HTTP Error 416" and "The requested range is not satisfiable", plus "Microsoft" in response headers. This harmless probe detects the vulnerable HTTP.sys range-handling code path that enables full RCE.
