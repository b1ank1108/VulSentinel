## Vulnerability
The WP Attachment Export WordPress plugin does not have proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to download the XML data that holds all the details of attachments/posts on a WordPress powered site. This includes details of even privately published posts and password protected posts with their passwords revealed in plain text. Unauthenticated attackers can download XML files containing sensitive attachment and post metadata including titles, author IDs, email addresses, and plaintext passwords for password-protected posts, potentially exposing confidential information and credentials from the WordPress site. Fixed in 0.2.4.  
CVSS v3.1: 7.5 (High) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin/tools.php?content=attachment&wp-attachment-export-download=true` and the variant with empty `content=` parameter (stop-at-first-match), then verifies the response with a DSL matcher requiring status_code == 200, Content-Type containing text/xml, and the body containing all of "title", "wp:author_id", "wp:author_email".
