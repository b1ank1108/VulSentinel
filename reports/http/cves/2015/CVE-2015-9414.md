## Vulnerability
WordPress Symposium plugin versions <=15.8.1 suffers from a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The flaw exists in the `get_album_item.php` file where the `size` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript via crafted URLs. This can lead to execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies and authentication credentials or performing other client-side attacks.

Description: WordPress Symposium through 15.8.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability via the wp-content/plugins/wp-symposium/get_album_item.php?size parameter which allows an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential data theft or unauthorized actions.

Remediation: Update to the latest version of the WordPress Symposium plugin (>=15.8.2) which includes a fix for this vulnerability.

CVSS: 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) | CWE-79

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs two HTTP requests. The first fetches `/wp-content/plugins/wp-symposium/readme.txt` and internally matches for 'WP Symposium' and 'Tags:' to confirm the plugin is present. The second request targets `/wp-content/plugins/wp-symposium/get_album_item.php` with a URL-encoded XSS payload (`</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`) in the `size` parameter. It verifies exploitation potential by checking if the unsanitized payload reflects in the response body, the content-type is text/html, and status is 200.
