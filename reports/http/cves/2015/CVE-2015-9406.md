## Vulnerability
mTheme-Unus WordPress theme prior to 2.3 contains a directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2015-9406, CWE-22) in `wp-content/themes/mTheme-Unus/css/css.php`. The `files` parameter can be manipulated with `../` sequences to read arbitrary files on the server.  
Impact: unauthenticated remote read of sensitive files (e.g. `wp-config.php` containing DB_NAME/DB_PASSWORD), enabling full site compromise.  
CVSS 3.1: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).  
Remediation: upgrade to 2.3 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/themes/mTheme-Unus/css/css.php?files=../../../../wp-config.php` and confirms exploitation by verifying that the HTTP 200 response body simultaneously contains the strings `DB_NAME` and `DB_PASSWORD`.
