## Vulnerability

Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in `includes/upload.php` of the Aviary Image Editor Add-on For Gravity Forms WordPress plugin 3.0 beta. Remote unauthenticated attackers can upload a file with an executable extension, then access it directly via `wp-content/uploads/gform_aviary` to execute arbitrary code and achieve full system compromise.

CVSS v3.0: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template detects the flaw with a two-request sequence: (1) GET to `/?gf_page=upload` and (2) POST multipart/form-data to the same endpoint containing path traversal (`gform_unique_id=../../../`), a logical filename ending in `.phtml` and a physical filename ending in `.jpg` with HTML content. Confirmation uses DSL matchers: `body_1` contains "Failed to upload file", `status_code_2 == 200`, and `body_2` contains the expected `uploaded_filename`.
