## Vulnerability
WordPress Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce plugin before 3.1.8 is vulnerable to authenticated reflected cross-site scripting via the unsanitized `tab` parameter on the admin page `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-order-export`. An authenticated attacker can supply a malicious URL containing arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the browser of any logged-in administrator who visits the link. This permits theft of session cookies, account takeover, defacement, or chained attacks in the context of the WordPress site. Impact is client-side script execution leading to data theft or further compromise. Fixed in 3.1.8. CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template first performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` with supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials, then issues a GET request to the vulnerable admin endpoint injecting the reflected XSS payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the `tab` query parameter. Detection succeeds if the second response returns HTTP 200, the raw payload appears unsanitized in the response body, and the body contains the plugin marker string "woo-order-export-lite".
