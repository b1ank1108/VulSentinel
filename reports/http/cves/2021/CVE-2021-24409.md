## Vulnerability
Prismatic WordPress plugin fails to escape the `tab` GET parameter before outputting it in an HTML attribute on `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=prismatic`. This produces a reflected XSS vulnerability exploitable only when a logged-in administrator visits a maliciously crafted URL.  

Execution occurs in the administrator’s browser context.  

**Impact** (per template): unauthorized access, data theft, session hijacking.  
**CVSS v3.1**: 6.1 (Medium) – AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  
**CWE**: CWE-79  
**Remediation**: Fixed in version 2.8.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change  

The template first POSTs credentials to `/wp-login.php` to obtain an authenticated administrator session, then issues a GET to the vulnerable settings page injecting the payload `tab=" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationend=alert(document.domain)//"`.  

Success is confirmed when the 200 response contains `text/html`, the plugin-specific string “Leave A Review?”, and the raw `onanimationend=alert(document.domain)` payload reflected unescaped in the body, proving the attribute is not sanitized and JavaScript would execute with administrator privileges.
