severity: critical

## Vulnerability
Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central contains an authentication bypass (CWE-287) that enables unauthenticated remote code execution on the server (including MSP edition). CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution on the affected system. Remediation: upgrade Enterprise builds 10.1.2127.17 and earlier to 10.1.2127.18 or 10.1.2128.0–10.1.2137.2 to 10.1.2137.3 (identical ranges and fixes apply to MSP builds).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce
The template issues one raw GET request to `/STATE_ID/123/agentLogUploader` with the crafted header `Cookie: STATE_COOKIE=&_REQS/_TIME/123`. It matches on `len(body) == 0`, presence of `UEMJSESSIONID=` in response headers, and HTTP status 200 to confirm the authentication bypass condition that permits RCE.
