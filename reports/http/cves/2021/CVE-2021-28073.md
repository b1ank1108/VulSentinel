## Vulnerability
Ntopng, a passive network monitoring tool, contains an authentication bypass vulnerability in versions <= 4.2. Successful exploitation could result in unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential compromise of the affected system. Remediation: upgrade to version 4.3 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass
The template sends two GET requests to heavily path-traversed URLs (multiple encoded `../` sequences using `%2e%2f` or `.%2f` variants) targeting `/lua/find_prefs.lua.css`. It matches on HTTP 200 status, `application/json` content-type header, and presence of JSON keys `"results":`, `"name":`, and `"tab":` in the response body to detect successful bypass and access to the protected preferences endpoint.
