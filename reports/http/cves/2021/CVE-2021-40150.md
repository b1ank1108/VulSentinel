## Vulnerability
Reolink E1 Zoom camera through 3.0.0.716 is susceptible to information disclosure. The web server discloses its configuration via the /conf/ directory that is mapped to a publicly accessible path. An attacker with network-level access to the camera can download the entire NGINX/FastCGI configurations by querying the /conf/nginx.conf or /conf/fastcgi.conf URI.

Impact: attacker gains access to sensitive configuration information, compromising user privacy and security.  
CVSS v3.1: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  
CWE-552

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/conf/nginx.conf` and confirms exposure by matching HTTP status 200 together with the AND presence of the strings "server", "listen", and "fastcgi" in the response body.
