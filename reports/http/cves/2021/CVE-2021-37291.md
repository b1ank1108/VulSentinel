## Vulnerability
KevinLAB BEMS 1.0 contains an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability. The `input_id` POST parameter in `/http/index.php` is not properly sanitized before use in SQL queries. Unauthenticated attackers can extract sensitive database contents, modify data, and execute unauthorized administrative operations (CWE-89, CVSS 9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues a single POST request to `/http/index.php` containing a login payload with an `EXTRACTVALUE(1337,CONCAT(...))` error-based payload injected into the `input_id` field (while supplying dummy `input_passwd`). Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 responses containing both the string "XPATH syntax error" and the marker ": '\\ZSL1ZSL'".
