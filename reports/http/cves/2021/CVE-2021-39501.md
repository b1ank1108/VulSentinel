## Vulnerability
EyouCMS 1.5.4 is vulnerable to an open redirect in the logout function (`/index.php?m=user&c=Users&a=logout`). An attacker supplies an arbitrary `referurl` parameter that is reflected unsanitized into the `Location` header, allowing redirection of any user who triggers logout to an attacker-controlled domain.  

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1) | CWE-601 | CPE `cpe:2.3:a:eyoucms:eyoucms:1.5.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*`.  

Successful exploitation enables phishing campaigns and credential theft. Remediation requires upgrading to a patched release.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?m=user&c=Users&a=logout&referurl=https://interact.sh` and inspects the `Location` response header with a regex that matches any redirect containing the `interact.sh` domain, confirming the open-redirect behavior.
