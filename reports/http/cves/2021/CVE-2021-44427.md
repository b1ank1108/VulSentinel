## Vulnerability
Rosario Student Information System (aka rosariosis) 8.1 and below contains an unauthenticated SQL injection in `/Side.php` via the `syear` parameter. Remote attackers can execute arbitrary PostgreSQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8).  
CWE-89.  
Impact includes sensitive data extraction, data modification/deletion, or full database control.  
Remediation: upgrade to 8.1.1 or higher.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues a single POST request to `{{BaseURL}}/Side.php` with body `sidefunc=update&syear=111'` (single-quote injection to trigger syntax error). It matches on:
- response body containing both "DB Execute Failed. ERROR:" and "unterminated quoted string"
- "RosarioSIS=" present in response headers
- HTTP 200 status

This confirms the error-based SQL injection point.
