## Vulnerability
FUDForum 3.1.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). An attacker can inject JavaScript via index.php in the author parameter, thereby possibly stealing cookie-based authentication credentials and launching other attacks.

**CVSS v3.1:** 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
**Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to the latest version of FUDForum or apply the provided patch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues unauthenticated GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?SQ=0&t=search&...&author=x"+onmouseover%3Dalert%28document.domain%29+x%3D` (and the `/forum/index.php` variant) embedding a test XSS payload. It stops at the first match and confirms the vulnerability if the response body contains the unsanitized payload string `onmouseover=alert(document.domain) x=` together with `FUDforum`, the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, and status is 200.
