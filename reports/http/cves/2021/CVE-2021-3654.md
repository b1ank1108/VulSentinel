## Vulnerability
Nova noVNC (OpenStack Nova component) is affected by CVE-2021-3654, an open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601). Unauthenticated attackers can force redirects to arbitrary attacker-controlled sites via crafted URLs (e.g., using `//domain`). This enables phishing attacks potentially resulting in sensitive data theft (CVSS 6.1: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Impact includes user redirection to malicious sites for phishing. No version ranges or additional preconditions (e.g., specific features or configs) are specified.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}//interact.sh/%2f..` and verifies the flaw by matching a 301/302 status code together with a Location header containing the attacker-controlled `interact.sh` domain (OOB callback confirmation of the unvalidated redirect).
