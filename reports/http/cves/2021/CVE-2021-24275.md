## Vulnerability

CVE-2021-24275 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WordPress Popup by Supsystic plugin versions prior to 1.10.5. The vulnerability exists in the plugin's options page where the `tab` parameter is not properly sanitized before being output in an HTML attribute. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `tab` parameter that will execute in the context of a victim's browser session when the URL is accessed. This allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious actions performed with the victim's privileges.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the WordPress admin panel at `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=popup-wp-supsystic` with a crafted `tab` parameter containing an XSS payload: `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. The detection verifies that:

1. The injected payload is reflected in the response body without proper sanitization
2. The response has a `text/html` content type header
3. The server returns a 200 OK status code

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking if the malicious script tags appear unescaped in the HTML response, indicating that user-supplied input is being directly inserted into the page without proper output encoding.
