## Vulnerability
ImpressCMS before 1.4.3 is susceptible to incorrect authorization via include/findusers.php. An attacker can provide a security token and potentially obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3). CWE-287.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template executes a two-step unauthenticated process:  
1. GET /misc.php?action=showpopups&type=friend to obtain a security token via regex extraction from the response body (matching REQUEST value patterns).  
2. GET /include/findusers.php?token={{extracted_token}} and matches for presence of 'last_login', 'user_regdate', 'uname' in the second response body along with HTTP 200 status.

This verifies the authorization bypass allowing disclosure of user account details.
