## Vulnerability
vRealize Operations Manager API is susceptible to server-side request forgery (SSRF, CWE-918). A malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can steal administrative credentials or trigger remote code execution using CVE-2021-21983.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to send arbitrary requests from the vulnerable server, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or further attacks.

Remediation: Apply the necessary security patches or updates provided by the vendor.

CVSS: 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs an unauthenticated POST request to `/casa/nodes/thumbprints` with JSON body `["127.0.0.1:443/ui/"]` and verifies a 200 response containing the words 'vRealize Operations Manager', 'thumbprint', and 'address'. This confirms the server fetched content from the supplied internal address via SSRF.
