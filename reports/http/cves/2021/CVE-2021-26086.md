## Vulnerability
CVE-2021-26086 is a path traversal vulnerability in Atlassian Jira Limited Server and Data Center allowing remote unauthenticated attackers to perform local file inclusion (LFI) and read sensitive files such as /WEB-INF/web.xml.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3, CWE-22). The flaw resides in the /s/{rand}/_/;/WEB-INF/web.xml endpoint handling.

**Impact**: Unauthorized access to sensitive files and data, as well as potential remote code execution leading to complete system compromise.  
**Remediation**: Apply the latest security patches and updates provided by Atlassian.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/s/{{randstr}}/_/;/WEB-INF/web.xml` and matches for HTTP 200 status along with the presence of both `<web-app>` and `</web-app>` strings in the response body to confirm successful file retrieval.
