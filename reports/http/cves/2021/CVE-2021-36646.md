## Vulnerability
KodExplorer is susceptible to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the file view functionality. The flaw exists in `app/template/api/view.html` where user-supplied input in the `path` parameter is directly echoed without sanitization in the `index.php?explorer/fileView` endpoint. This permits injection of arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser context (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first fingerprints the target by issuing a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` and matching the string "KodExplorer" in the response body. It then sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?explorer/fileView&path=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies exploitation if the exact unsanitized payload appears verbatim in the response body, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and the HTTP status code is 200.
