## Vulnerability
Jellyfin before 10.7.0 is vulnerable to local file inclusion (CWE-22). The flaw is more prevalent when Windows is used as the host OS; public Internet-exposed servers are at heightened risk. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary sensitive files on the server (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, score 6.5). Fixed in 10.7.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues two unauthenticated GET requests with Windows-style path-traversal payloads (`..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5CWindows%5Cwin.ini`) appended to the `/Audio/1/hls/` and `/Videos/1/hls/` media-streaming endpoints, requesting the file as `/stream.mp3`. It verifies success by confirming HTTP 200, `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` header, and regex presence of INI section markers `[font]`, `[extension]` or `[file]` in the response body.
