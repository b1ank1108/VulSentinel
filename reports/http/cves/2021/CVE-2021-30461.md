## Vulnerability
VoipMonitor prior to 24.61 is susceptible to remote code execution because of unsafe use of user-supplied data via its web interface, allowing remote unauthenticated users to trigger PHP code execution.  
Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution on the affected system.  
CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
CWE-94

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues a single POST request to `/index.php` with form-encoded payload `SPOOLDIR=test".system(id)."&recheck=Recheck` (injecting a direct `system(id)` call). It verifies exploitation by matching HTTP 200 status plus the strings `uid=`, `gid=`, `groups=` and `VoIPmonitor installation` in the response body.
