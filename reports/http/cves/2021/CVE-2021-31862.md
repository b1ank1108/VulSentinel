## Vulnerability
SysAid 20.4.74 is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in KeepAlive.jsp. The `stamp` parameter fails to sanitize user input, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript payloads that execute in the victim's browser context when the crafted URL is visited.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Potential impacts include session hijacking, page defacement, and sensitive information theft.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/KeepAlive.jsp?stamp=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E` and verifies the vulnerability if the response status is 200 and the body exactly matches "false <script>alert(document.domain)</script>", confirming unsanitized reflection of the script tag.
