## Vulnerability

WordPress Duplicate Page or Post plugin versions before 1.5.1 contain a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability exists in the `wpdevart_duplicate_post_parametrs_save_in_db` AJAX action, which lacks proper authorization checks and has a flawed CSRF protection mechanism. This allows attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious scripts. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and has a CVSS score of 3.5 (Low severity). Successful exploitation could lead to injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, potentially resulting in data theft, session hijacking, or website defacement.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: state-change

The template performs an authenticated exploitation test in three steps:

1. **Authentication**: Logs into WordPress using provided credentials via POST to `/wp-login.php`
2. **Exploitation**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action `wpdevart_duplicate_post_parametrs_save_in_db`, injecting an XSS payload into the `title_prefix` parameter: `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/) p`
3. **Verification**: Accesses the plugin's admin page at `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpda_duplicate_post_menu` to verify the stored XSS payload is reflected in the response

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking for:
- Presence of the injected XSS payload in the response body
- The string "toplevel_page_wpda_duplicate_post_menu" indicating the plugin's admin page
- HTTP 200 status code
- Content-Type header containing "text/html"
