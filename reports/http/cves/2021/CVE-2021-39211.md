## Vulnerability
GLPI versions 9.2 to <9.5.6 expose sensitive GLPI and server information (including UUID) through the unprotected telemetry endpoint.  
Unauthenticated remote attackers can read this data, leading to information disclosure.  
CVSS 3.1: 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).  
Fixed in 9.5.6; workaround is to delete `ajax/telemetry.php` (not required for normal operation).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues unauthenticated GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/ajax/telemetry.php` and `{{BaseURL}}/glpi/ajax/telemetry.php`, then matches HTTP 200 responses containing both the strings `"uuid":` and `"glpi":` to confirm the endpoint is active and leaking data.
