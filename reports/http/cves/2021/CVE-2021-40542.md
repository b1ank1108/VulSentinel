## Vulnerability
Opensis-Classic 8.0 is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code by manipulating the `link_url` parameter in the `Ajax_url_encode.php` script.

The flaw allows malicious scripts to be reflected in responses without sanitization, executing in the context of users who access the crafted URL. CVSS 3.1 score: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/Ajax_url_encode.php?link_url=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` and checks for reflection of the unsanitized payload string `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the response body, combined with HTTP 200 status and text/html content-type. This verifies the lack of output encoding that enables the XSS.
