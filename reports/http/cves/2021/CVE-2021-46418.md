## Vulnerability
Telesquare TLR-2855KS6 is vulnerable to an unauthorized arbitrary file creation issue via the HTTP PUT method. Unauthenticated attackers can create arbitrary files, including CGI scripts in the /cgi-bin directory on the lighttpd web server. This allows potential remote code execution.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce
The template detects the vulnerability by issuing a PUT request to `/cgi-bin/{{rand_base(6)}}.txt` containing random data (expecting HTTP 201 Created), followed by a GET request to the same path. Matchers confirm the lighttpd server header, text/plain content-type on the GET response, and presence of the random payload in the body. This probe confirms the arbitrary file-write flaw that can be escalated to remote code execution by uploading executable CGI scripts.
