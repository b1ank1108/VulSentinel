## Vulnerability
WordPress FoodBakery plugin before 2.2 contains an unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. It does not properly sanitize the foodbakery_radius parameter before outputting it back in the response.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the affected website, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1), CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/listings/?search_title=&location=&foodbakery_locations_position=filter&search_type=autocomplete&foodbakery_radius=10%22%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`, then verifies the exact unsanitized payload string `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` appears in the response body (with Content-Type containing text/html and status 200) to confirm reflection of the XSS payload.
