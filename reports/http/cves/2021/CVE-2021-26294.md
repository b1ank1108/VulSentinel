## Vulnerability
AfterLogic Aurora and WebMail Pro <= 7.7.9 suffer from information disclosure (CWE-22) via the WebDAV endpoint. Unauthenticated attackers send a single HTTP GET request to `/dav/server.php/files/personal/%2e%2e/%2e%2e//%2e%2e//%2e%2e/data/settings/settings.xml` using the built-in hardcoded credentials `caldav_public_user@localhost:caldav_public_user` combined with directory traversal to read any file under the web root, including `settings.xml` that contains `<AdminLogin>`, `<AdminPassword>`, and `<DBHost>`. CVSS 3.1 score 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). Impact includes exposure of sensitive configuration data, credentials, and proprietary information. Remediation requires upgrade to 7.7.10 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues one raw GET request to the path-traversed WebDAV URL with `Authorization: Basic Y2FsZGF2X3B1YmxpY191c2VyQGxvY2FsaG9zdDpjYWxkYXZfcHVibGljX3VzZXI` header. Detection succeeds when the response body contains all three words `<AdminLogin>`, `<AdminPassword>`, `<DBHost>` (AND), the `Content-Type` header contains `application/octet-stream`, and HTTP status is 200.
