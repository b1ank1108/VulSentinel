## Vulnerability
Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System 2.3.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) via the `msg` parameter. The input is reflected unsanitized into the HTML response body. An attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked by a victim, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context, enabling page-content modification (changing website visibility), theft of sensitive client-side data, or other unauthorized client-side actions. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 4.3). CPE: cpe:2.3:a:online_event_booking_and_reservation_system_project:online_event_booking_and_reservation_system:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs authentication by POSTing `name={{username}}&pwd={{password}}` to `/login.php`, then issues a GET request to `/views/index.php?msg=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` (with `host-redirects: true` and `max-redirects: 2`). It confirms the vulnerability if the response body contains the exact unsanitized string `</i><script>alert(document.domain)</script></div>`, the `Content-Type` header includes `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
