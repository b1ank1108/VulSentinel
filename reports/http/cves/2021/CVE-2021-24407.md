## Vulnerability
WordPress Jannah theme before 5.4.5 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. The `tie_ajax_search` AJAX action does not properly sanitize the `query` POST parameter.

CVSS: 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE: CWE-79  
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, resulting in data theft, session hijacking, or website defacement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-step HTTP flow.  
1. GET / checks the homepage body for Jannah-specific strings (`/wp-content/themes/jannah/assets/` or `attachment-jannah-image-`) to confirm the theme is active.  
2. POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php sends `action=tie_ajax_search&query[]=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies the exact payload is reflected unsanitized in the response body, Content-Type contains `text/html`, and status is 200.
