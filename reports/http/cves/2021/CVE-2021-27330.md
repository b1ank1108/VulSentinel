## Vulnerability
Triconsole Datepicker Calendar < 3.77 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `calendar_form.php` (CWE-79). Unauthenticated remote attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript through the URL path, which is reflected unsanitized and executes in the victim's browser context. Impacts include theft of active authentication cookies (enabling session hijacking), reading browser history, directory listings, and file contents.  
CVSS: 6.1 (Medium) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template detects the vulnerability by sending a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/calendar/calendar_form.php/"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifying that the injected `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` payload appears verbatim in the response body (AND page title matches the expected Triconsole calendar page AND Content-Type contains `text/html` with status 200).
