## Vulnerability
WordPress Kaswara Modern VC Addons plugin through 3.0.1 is susceptible to unauthenticated arbitrary file upload via the uploadFontIcon AJAX action. The supplied ZIP file is unzipped in wp-content/uploads/kaswara/fonts_icon with no checks for malicious files such as PHP, enabling remote code execution. CVSS 3.1 score 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Successful exploitation results in full server compromise on the WordPress site.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs a two-step verification: (1) POSTs a crafted multipart/form-data ZIP archive (containing a randomly-named PHP file that executes `md5('CVE-2021-24284')` then self-deletes) to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=uploadFontIcon`; (2) immediately GETs the extracted PHP at `/wp-content/uploads/kaswara/fonts_icon/<random>/<random>.php`. Detection succeeds when the upload response body references the expected style.css path, the second response returns HTTP 200 containing the MD5 hash, confirming arbitrary PHP execution.
