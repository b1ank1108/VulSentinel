## Vulnerability
OctoberCMS (Laravel-based CMS) is affected by an account takeover flaw in the october/system package. Unauthenticated attackers can request a password reset for any user (including administrators) and complete takeover using a specially crafted request. The vulnerability was patched in Build 472 and v1.1.5.

**CVSS:** 8.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)  
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and full administrative compromise.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to Build 472 or v1.1.5 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template executes the full exploit chain against the hardcoded "admin" account to confirm the flaw:  
1. GET `/backend/backend/auth/restore` extracts CSRF token from the restore page.  
2. POST restore request for username "admin".  
3. POST to `/backend/backend/auth/reset/1/{{random_token}}` (JSON) sets a new random password.  
4. GET signin page extracts `_session_key`, then POSTs login with new credentials.  
5. Verifies success via 302 redirect containing both `october_session=` and `admin_auth=` cookies.
