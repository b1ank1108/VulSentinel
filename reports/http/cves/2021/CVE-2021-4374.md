## Vulnerability
WordPress Automatic Plugin versions 3.53.2 and below contain a critical unauthenticated arbitrary options-change vulnerability in the standalone `process_form.php` script. The endpoint accepts all POST parameters and blindly passes them to `update_option()` with no authentication, capability checks, sanitization, or validation. Attackers can therefore modify any WordPress option (e.g., create administrator accounts, change site settings). The flaw persists even when the plugin is fully deactivated because the script is not gated behind plugin activation logic.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8) | CWE-862 Missing Authorization.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues a POST to `/wp-content/plugins/wp-automatic/process_form.php` with form fields that set `blogdescription` (and filler fields) to a random string value, then performs a GET to `/` and verifies the random string appears in the response body, confirming the option update succeeded. The check is intrusive and actually modifies the target site's configuration.
