## Vulnerability
QSAN Storage Manager before 3.3.3 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. Header page parameters do not filter special characters, allowing remote attackers to inject JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser context. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1). CWE-79. Successful exploitation enables session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information. Remediation: upgrade to 3.3.3 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template issues a single GET request to `/http_header.php` supplying the custom header `X-Trigger-XSS: "<script>alert(1)</script>"`. It verifies the condition by confirming the payload appears unsanitized in the response body as `"HTTP_X_TRIGGER_XSS":"<script>alert(1)</script>"`, the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, and the `X-XSS-Protection` header is absent.
