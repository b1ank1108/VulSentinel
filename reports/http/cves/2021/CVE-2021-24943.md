## Vulnerability
Registrations for the Events Calendar WordPress plugin before 2.7.6 contains an unauthenticated SQL injection in the `rtec_send_unregister_link` AJAX action (POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`). The `event_id` parameter is concatenated unsanitized into a SQL statement, enabling time-based blind SQLi (CWE-89). Impact includes extraction of all Events Calendar registration/attendee data. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Fixed in 2.7.6.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues one raw POST request injecting `event_id=3 AND (SELECT 1874 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))vNpy)` with a random email address, then asserts the response took ≥5 s, returned HTTP 200, and contained the string "Please enter the email you registered with" to confirm the time-based blind SQL injection.
