## Vulnerability
Pascom packaged with Cloud Phone System (CPS) versions before 7.20 contain a known local file inclusion vulnerability. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, execute arbitrary code, or perform other malicious activities. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). CWE-918.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues three sequential raw HTTP GET requests to the target: (1) baseline `/services/pluginscript/`, (2) path-traversal `/services/pluginscript/..;/..;/`, (3) `/`. It matches on the DSL condition `status_code_2 != status_code_1` to confirm that the traversal sequence produces a different server response than the baseline, indicating successful LFI exploitation.
