## Vulnerability
AlquistManager branch as of commit 280d99f43b11378212652e75f6f3159cde9c1d36 is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in `alquist/IO/input.py`. Unauthenticated remote attackers can perform local file inclusion to disclose critical secrets stored anywhere on the system (CVSS 3.1 Base Score 7.5, vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N), significantly aiding further compromise including remote code execution.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/asd/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` and matches the regex `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body to confirm successful arbitrary file read.
