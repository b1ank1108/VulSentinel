## Vulnerability
Online Event Booking and Reservation System 2.3.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the event-management/views component. An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries via the ID parameter, allowing extraction of sensitive database information, data modification, and unauthorized administrative operations.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first authenticates by sending a POST request to `/login.php` with `name={{username}}&pwd={{password}}`. It then issues a GET request to `/views/?v=USER&ID=1 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,md5(999999999),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL;-- -` (using the `num` variable) and verifies the vulnerability if the MD5 hash of `999999999` appears in the response body with HTTP status 200.
