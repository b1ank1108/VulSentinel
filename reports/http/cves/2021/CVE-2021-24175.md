## Vulnerability
The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder WordPress plugin before version 4.1.7 is vulnerable to authentication bypass (CVE-2021-24175, CWE-287, CVSS 9.8 Critical). Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms, gain administrator access, and create new accounts with elevated privileges, even when user registration is disabled and the Login widget is inactive. This leads to complete site takeover. Fixed in 4.1.7.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The Nuclei template detects vulnerable installations via a passive check: it performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/the-plus-addons-for-elementor-page-builder/readme.txt`, verifies the response contains "The Plus Addons for Elementor" and status 200, then extracts the Stable tag version using regex and checks if it is less than 4.1.7.
