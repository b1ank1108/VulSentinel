## Vulnerability
Hongdian H8922 3.0.5 firmware suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker can access the `cli.conf` file (containing the administrator password and other sensitive CLI configuration data) by requesting `/backup2.cgi`. This may allow obtaining sensitive information, modifying data, and/or executing unauthorized operations.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 5.5, CWE-425).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues two raw GET requests to `/backup2.cgi` using Basic Authentication headers for `guest:guest` and `admin:admin` default credentials. Detection succeeds if the response has status 200, `application/octet-stream` content-type header, and body contains "CLI configuration saved from vty" and "service webadmin" strings (matchers-condition: and).
