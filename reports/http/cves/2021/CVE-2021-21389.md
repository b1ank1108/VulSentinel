WordPress BuddyPress before version 7.2.1 is susceptible to a privilege escalation vulnerability in the REST API that can be leveraged to perform remote code execution (CVE-2021-21389, CWE-863). Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, escalate privileges, or execute arbitrary code on the affected system. Remediated in BuddyPress 7.2.1. CVSSv3.1: 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
