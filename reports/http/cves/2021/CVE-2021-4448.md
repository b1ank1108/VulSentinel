## Vulnerability
Kaswara Modern VC Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass (missing authorization, CWE-862) in versions up to and including 3.0.1 due to insufficient capability checking on multiple AJAX actions. Unauthenticated attackers can import data, upload arbitrary files, delete arbitrary files, and perform other privileged operations, potentially leading to full site compromise.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L (score 7.3).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` containing `action=kaswaraImportDemo&contentUrl=http://{{interactsh-url}}/`. It detects the vulnerability when the response body contains the string `missing/invalid WXR version number`, the status code is 200, and an HTTP callback is received at the interactsh server. This confirms the AJAX handler executes without any authentication or capability checks.
