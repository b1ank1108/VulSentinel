## Vulnerability
Emerson Dixell XWEB-500 is affected by an unauthenticated arbitrary file write vulnerability (CVE-2021-45420, CVSS 9.8). The flaw is caused by missing authentication on CGI endpoints /cgi-bin/logo_extra_upload.cgi, /cgi-bin/cal_save.cgi, and /cgi-bin/lo_utils.cgi, allowing remote attackers to write arbitrary files anywhere on the filesystem (e.g., malicious CGI scripts or system files). CPE: cpe:2.3:h:emerson:dixell_xweb-500:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*. CWE-200 listed but description indicates file-write impact.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template verifies the flaw by issuing a POST request to /cgi-bin/logo_extra_upload.cgi containing a random filename with octet-stream payload "dixell-xweb500-filewrite", followed by a GET to /logo/{{randstr}}.txt. It matches on HTTP 200 and presence of the test string in the retrieved body (max-requests: 2).
