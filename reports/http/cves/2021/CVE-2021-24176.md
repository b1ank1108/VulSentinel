## Vulnerability
WordPress JH 404 Logger plugin through version 1.1 is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The Referer header and path from 404 error pages are not sanitized before output in the WordPress admin dashboard, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in an administrator's browser context.  

**Impact**  
Successful exploitation enables data theft, session hijacking, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the logged-in admin.  

**CVSS 3.1**  
5.4 (Medium) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  
**CWE**  
CWE-79  
**Remediation**  
Update to version 1.2 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only  

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/jh-404-logger/readme.txt` and verifies the presence of the static string "JH 404 Logger" in the body plus HTTP 200. This serves as a harmless fingerprint confirming the vulnerable plugin is installed; no XSS payload is sent and no vulnerable endpoint is exercised.
