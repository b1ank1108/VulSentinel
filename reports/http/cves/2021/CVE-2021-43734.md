## Vulnerability
kkFileview v4.0.0 is vulnerable to local file inclusion (LFI) which may lead to a sensitive file leak on a related host. An unauthenticated remote attacker can read arbitrary local files by supplying `file://` URIs to the `urlPath` parameter of the `/getCorsFile` endpoint. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5), CWE-22. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, remote code execution, and potential compromise of the entire system. Remediation: upgrade to v4.0.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/getCorsFile?urlPath=file:///etc/passwd` and `{{BaseURL}}/getCorsFile?urlPath=file:///c://windows/win.ini` (stop-at-first-match). It verifies exploitation by matching HTTP 200 status combined with regex patterns indicating successful file reads ("root:.*:0:0:" or "for 16-bit app support").
