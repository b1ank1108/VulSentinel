## Vulnerability
KevinLAB BEMS (Building Energy Management System) contains an undocumented hardcoded backdoor account with credentials `kevinlab`:`kevin003`. The account is invisible in the admin user settings, cannot be changed or disabled through normal operations, and uses an undocumented highest-privilege level (`admin_pk=1`), granting full remote administrative control upon successful login.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues a single unauthenticated POST to `/http/index.php` with form-encoded parameters setting `requester=login`, `request=login`, and the backdoor values for `input_id`, `input_passwd`, `device_key`, `auto_login`, and `login_key`. It then matches on HTTP 200 status plus body containing `"result":true` and either a `data` or `login_key` alphanumeric field to confirm the backdoor login succeeded.
