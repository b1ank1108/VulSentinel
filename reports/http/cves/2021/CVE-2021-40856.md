## Vulnerability
Auerswald COMfortel 1400/2600/3600 IP is susceptible to an authentication bypass vulnerability. Inserting the prefix "/about/../" allows bypassing the authentication check for the web-based configuration management interface. This enables attackers to gain access to the login credentials used for authentication at the PBX, among other data.

An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the device.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5)  
CWE-706

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues a raw GET request to `/about/../tree?action=get` and verifies success via HTTP status 200, `Content-Type: application/json` header, and the presence of the JSON keys `"TYPE"`, `"ITEMS"`, and `"COUNT"` in the response body. This confirms the path-prefix bypass grants unauthenticated access to protected internal tree data.
