## Vulnerability
WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) WordPress plugin versions <= 3.1.23 is vulnerable to unauthenticated arbitrary post/page deletion. The AJAX action `admin-dismiss-unsubscribe` lacks capability check, nonce check, and post-type validation, and is reachable by unauthenticated users. An attacker supplies any post ID to move the target to trash (first request) then permanently delete it (repeat request).

Impact: Unauthenticated attackers can permanently delete arbitrary WordPress posts and pages.  
Remediation: Upgrade to version 3.1.24 or later.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (score 7.5).  
CWE: CWE-862, CWE-284.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template actively exploits and verifies deletion in a three-step flow:  
- Clusterbomb GET to `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts` or `?rest_route=/wp/v2/posts` extracts the first post `id` from JSON response.  
- Una authenticated POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=admin-dismiss-unsubscribe&id={{post_id}}`.  
- Second clusterbomb GET to the same REST endpoint confirms the extracted `id` is absent from the JSON array.

The detection is intrusive and permanently deletes one post on vulnerable targets.
