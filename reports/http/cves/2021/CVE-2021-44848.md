## Vulnerability
Thinfinity VirtualUI before v3.0 is affected by a user-enumeration vulnerability (CWE-203). The /changePassword endpoint returns different responses depending on whether the supplied username exists, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to enumerate valid usernames, including OS-level accounts such as Administrator and Guest. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3). Impact includes enabling follow-on attacks such as password brute-forcing or targeted phishing.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/changePassword?username=administrator` and matches on HTTP 200 status together with the presence of both JSON fragments `"rc":(.*?)` and `"msg":"(.*?)"` in the response body to confirm the differential response behavior.
