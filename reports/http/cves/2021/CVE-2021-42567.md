## Vulnerability
Apereo CAS through 6.4.1 allows cross-site scripting via POST requests sent to the REST API endpoints such as /cas/v1/tickets/.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1) | CWE-79

Successful exploitation allows execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement. Patches are available in later releases.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends an unauthenticated POST request with an XSS payload in the `username` form field (`<img/src/onerror=alert(document.domain)>`) to `/cas/v1/tickets/`. Detection succeeds if the response body reflects the raw payload along with `java.util.HashMap` and returns HTTP 401 status.
