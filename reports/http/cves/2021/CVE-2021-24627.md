cve_id: CVE-2021-24627
template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2021/CVE-2021-24627.yaml
affected_product: G Auto-Hyperlink WordPress plugin
severity: high
authentication: required
external_callback: false
affected_versions: through 1.0.1
preconditions: G Auto-Hyperlink plugin installed and activated on WordPress (admin dashboard endpoint present)
poc_classification: info-leak
---

## Vulnerability
The G Auto-Hyperlink WordPress plugin through 1.0.1 does not sanitise or escape the `id` GET parameter before using it in a SQL statement to select data for display in the admin dashboard (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=g-auto-hyperlink-edit`). This leads to authenticated SQL injection (CWE-89).

Authenticated administrators can exploit it to extract database contents via UNION queries, exposing sensitive WordPress configuration and user data. CVSS 3.1: 7.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Remediation: update to version 1.0.2 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first POSTs credentials to `/wp-login.php` to establish an authenticated admin session, then issues a GET to the vulnerable endpoint with `id=-2198+UNION+ALL+SELECT+NULL%2Cmd5%28999999999%29%2Ccurrent_user%28%29%2Ccurrent_user%28%29%2CNULL%2CNULL%2CNULL%2CNULL%2CNULL--`. Detection confirms successful injection and data exfiltration if the second response body contains the MD5 hash `c8c605999f3d8352d7bb792cf3fdb25b` plus the strings `Keyword` and `g-auto-hyperlink-edit`, the `text/html` content-type header, and HTTP 200 status.
