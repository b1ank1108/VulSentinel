## Vulnerability
Advantech R-SeeNet 2.4.12 contains an OS command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) in the ping.php script. Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands via specially crafted HTTP requests to the hostname parameter, enabling malware execution, sensitive data access, data modification, and full system control.  
CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Impact: Remote arbitrary command execution on the affected system.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template detects the vulnerability by issuing a GET request to `/php/ping.php?hostname=|dir` and verifying successful injection through specific response matchers: body contains `<title>Ping |dir</title>` AND `bottom.php`, Content-Type header includes `text/html`, and status code 200.
