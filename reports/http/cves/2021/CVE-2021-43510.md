## Vulnerability
Sourcecodester Simple Client Management System 1.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability via the username field in login.php. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8), CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a POST request to `/classes/Login.php?f=login` with the raw payload `username=admin'+or+'1'%3d'1'--+-&password=as` to inject SQL and bypass authentication. It follows with a GET request to `/` and confirms success via DSL matchers on both responses: status_code_1 == 200, contains(header_1, "text/html"), contains(body_1, "{\"status\":\"success\"}"), and contains(body_2, "Welcome to Simple Client").
