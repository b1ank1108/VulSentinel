## Vulnerability
WordPress wpForo Forum plugin (gvectors/wpforo_forum) versions prior to 1.9.7 fails to validate the `redirect_to` parameter supplied to the forum login form (`/community/?foro=signin`). After a successful login, the browser is redirected to any attacker-controlled URL. CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N); CWE-601. Impact includes phishing campaigns that can capture credentials or trigger drive-by attacks; no server-side code execution or data modification occurs.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/community/?foro=signin&redirect_to=https://interact.sh/` and inspects the `Location` response header with a regex match for any domain containing `interact.sh`. A positive match confirms the open-redirect behavior; the probe itself performs no state changes, data exfiltration, or destructive actions.
