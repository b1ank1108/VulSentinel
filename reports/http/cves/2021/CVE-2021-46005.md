## Vulnerability
Sourcecodester Car Rental Management System 1.0 contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `vehicalorcview` parameter when submitting vehicle details via the admin interface (/admin/post-avehical.php). 

CVSS 3.1: 5.4 (Medium) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (CWE-79). An authenticated low-privileged user can inject scripts that execute in victims' browsers with elevated context due to the stored nature.

Impact includes potential session hijacking, credential theft, or arbitrary client-side code execution.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template authenticates via POST /admin/ using {{username}}/{{password}}, then uses a multipart POST to /admin/post-avehical.php to submit vehicle data with XSS payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in vehicalorcview field (along with dummy images and values). Finally, it performs a GET / and matches for the unsanitized payload in the response body to confirm storage and reflection.
