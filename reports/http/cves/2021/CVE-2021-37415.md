## Vulnerability
Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus before 11302 is vulnerable to authentication bypass that allows a few REST-API URLs without authentication (CWE-306).  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8).  
Impact includes access to sensitive functionalities and data without authentication, potentially leading to data disclosure or unauthorized actions.  
Remediation: update to version 11302 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/api/v3/{{randbase(8)}}/../announcements` and verifies success if the response is HTTP 200 with `application/json` content-type containing the strings `"status_code":2000`, `"has_more_rows"`, and `"start_index"`.
