## Vulnerability
Visual Tools DVR VX16 4.2.28.0 contains an unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) in the `/cgi-bin/slogin/login.py` endpoint. A remote attacker can inject arbitrary operating system commands via the User-Agent header.

CVSS 3.1 score: 9.8 (Critical) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Successful exploitation leads to full remote code execution, compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a GET request to `/cgi-bin/slogin/login.py` with User-Agent set to the payload `() { :; }; echo ; echo ; /bin/cat /etc/passwd` (shellshock-style command injection). 

Matchers verify HTTP 200 status and presence of the regex `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body to confirm the injected command executed and leaked `/etc/passwd`.
