## Vulnerability
HPE Edgeline Infrastructure Manager (also known as HPE Edgeline Infrastructure Management Software) prior to version 1.22 contains an authentication bypass vulnerability (CWE-306) which could be remotely exploited to bypass remote authentication and possibly lead to execution of arbitrary commands, gaining privileged access, causing denial of service, and changing the configuration.

Successful exploitation could result in unauthorized access to sensitive information, unauthorized configuration changes, or disruption of the affected system.

Remediation: Upgrade to version 1.22 or later.  
CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects the vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated PATCH request to `/redfish/v1/SessionService/ResetPassword/1/` that sets the Administrator account password to a random string, followed by a POST request to `/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/` that creates a new session using the Administrator username and the newly-set password. Success is verified when the response includes `X-Auth-Token`, `PasswordReset`, and `Location` in headers (AND condition), `Base.1.0.Created` in body, and HTTP status 201.
