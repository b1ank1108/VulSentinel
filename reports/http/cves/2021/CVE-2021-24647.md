## Vulnerability
Pie Register WordPress plugin (product: pie_register by genetechsolutions) before 3.7.1.6 contains an improper authentication flaw (CWE-287) in its social login implementation. An unauthenticated remote attacker who knows only a target user ID or username can log in as that user (including administrators) by supplying `social_site=true` and `user_id_social_site=<ID>` parameters to the login endpoint.  
**Impact:** Full unauthorized site access and potential compromise of sensitive data or administrative functions.  
**Remediation:** Update to version 3.7.1.6 or later.  
**CVSS 3.1:** 8.1 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template first issues a GET to `/wp-content/plugins/pie-register/readme.txt` and confirms the string “pieregister” is present. It then sends a POST to `/login/` containing `log=<rand>&pwd=<rand>&social_site=true&user_id_social_site=1&wp-submit=Log+In&testcookie=1` (no valid credentials). Finally it performs a GET to `/wp-admin/profile.php` and asserts the response is HTTP 200 and contains both “Username” and “email-description”, proving the login succeeded as user ID 1 without authentication.
