## Vulnerability
SysAid Technologies 20.3.64 b14 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability via the `/KeepAlive.jsp?stamp=` URI. User input to the `stamp` parameter is reflected unsanitized into the HTML response body.

CVSS 3.1 score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). CWE-79.  
Impact: attacker-supplied JavaScript executes in the victim's browser, enabling session hijacking, page defacement, or theft of sensitive information.  
Remediation: apply latest patch or upgrade to non-vulnerable version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/KeepAlive.jsp?stamp=16170297</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. It matches on the exact unsanitized payload string appearing in the response body, combined with HTTP 200 status and `text/html` Content-Type header, confirming the reflection point is exploitable for client-side script execution leading to information disclosure.
