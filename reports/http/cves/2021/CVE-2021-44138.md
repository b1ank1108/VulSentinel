## Vulnerability
Caucho Resin versions >=4.0.52 <=4.0.56 contains a directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2021-44138, CWE-22) that allows remote unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files via a semicolon (`;`) injected in the pathname of an HTTP request.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5).  
Impact includes exposure of sensitive server files such as configuration XML. Remediation requires upgrading to a version higher than 4.0.56.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the flaw by sending unauthenticated GET requests to the traversal payloads `{{BaseURL}}/;/WEB-INF/web.xml` and `{{BaseURL}}/resin-doc/;/WEB-INF/resin-web.xml` (stopping at first match). Success is confirmed if the response body contains both `<web-app>` and `</web-app>`, the header Content-Type is `text/xml` or `application/xml`, and status is 200.
