## Vulnerability
Contact Form Entries WordPress plugin versions < 1.2.4 is affected by reflected cross-site scripting (CVE-2021-25079, CWE-79). The plugin fails to sanitise and escape parameters such as form_id, status, end_date, order, orderby and search before outputting them on the admin entries page.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).  
Impact: attackers can inject malicious JavaScript via crafted URLs, enabling theft of administrator session cookies or access to contact form submission data.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first authenticates by POSTing credentials to /wp-login.php, then sends a GET request to /wp-admin/admin.php?page=vxcf_leads with an XSS payload injected into the end_date parameter (onobw"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>z2u4g) while setting other parameters such as form_id=cf_5 and orderby=file-438. It verifies the flaw by confirming HTTP 200, text/html content-type, and presence of the unsanitized <script>alert(document.domain)</script> string plus "contact-form" in the response body.
