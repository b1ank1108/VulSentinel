## Vulnerability

The Profile Builder plugin for WordPress (< 3.4.9) contains an improper authentication vulnerability (CWE-287) in its password reset functionality. Unauthenticated remote attackers can reset the password of any user (including administrators) without authorization by supplying a crafted recovery key and valid nonce, leading to full administrative access and complete site compromise.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Impact: account takeover. Remediation: update to 3.4.9 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template actively exploits the flaw to confirm unauthorized account modification. It issues a GET request to `{{path}}/?key=%3Ca%3E` and extracts the `password_recovery_nonce_field2` value via regex from the response body. It then sends a multipart/form-data POST to the same endpoint, submitting a randomly generated password for `userData=1` (default admin account) along with the extracted nonce, `key=<a>`, and recovery form fields. Success is matched on HTTP status 200 combined with the string "Your password has been successfully changed" in the body; the new password is also extracted.
