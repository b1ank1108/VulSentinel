## Vulnerability
D-Link DIR-3040 firmware version 1.13B03 is vulnerable to information disclosure in the Syslog functionality. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/messages` endpoint, leaking sensitive syslog data that includes admin references and internal file paths such as `/etc_ro/lighttpd/www`. Exploitation can expose user accounts and other sensitive information, enabling further attacks involving data access, modification, or unauthorized operations.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score: 4.3)  
CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/messages` and confirms the vulnerability when the response body simultaneously contains the strings "syslog:", "admin", and "/etc_ro/lighttpd/www" while returning HTTP status 200.
