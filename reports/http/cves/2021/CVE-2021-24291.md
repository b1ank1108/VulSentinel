## Vulnerability

WordPress Photo Gallery by 10Web plugin before 1.5.69 is affected by multiple reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The issues occur when the `bwg_frontend_data` AJAX action processes unsanitized `gallery_id`, `tag`, `album_id`, and `theme_id` GET parameters. 

The vulnerability impacts both unauthenticated and authenticated users. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1, Medium). CWE-79. Successful exploitation allows malicious JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context, enabling session hijacking, defacement, or sensitive data theft.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=bwg_frontend_data&shortcode_id=1"%20onmouseover=alert(document.domain)//` and checks for successful reflection of the XSS payload in the response body (along with photo gallery upload paths), HTTP 200 status, and text/html content-type to confirm the lack of input sanitization.
