## Vulnerability
WordPress Redux Framework plugin through 4.2.11 registers predictable AJAX actions (MD5 of site URL + known "-redux" salt, then MD5 of that result + "-support" salt) in `redux-core/class-redux-core.php`. These actions are available to unauthenticated users and disclose a list of active plugins with versions, the site's PHP version, and an unsalted MD5 hash of `AUTH_KEY` concatenated with `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues two raw GET requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action={{md5(replace('http://HOST/-redux','HOST',Hostname))}}` (and the https variant), stops at the first match, and confirms the leak with status 200, body length <50 bytes, and presence of a 32-character hexadecimal string.
