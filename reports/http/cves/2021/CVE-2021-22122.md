## Vulnerability
FortiWeb 6.3.0 through 6.3.7 and versions before 6.2.4 contain an unauthenticated cross-site scripting vulnerability. Improper neutralization of input during web page generation can allow a remote attacker to inject malicious payload in vulnerable API end-points.  
Successful exploitation can result in compromise of sensitive user information and session hijacking (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, score 6.1; CWE-79).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends two unauthenticated GET requests to `/error3?msg=30&data=';alert('document.domain');//` and `/omni_success?cmdb_edit_path=\");alert('document.domain');//` then verifies reflection by matching both `alert('document.domain')` and `No policy has been chosen.` in the response body.
