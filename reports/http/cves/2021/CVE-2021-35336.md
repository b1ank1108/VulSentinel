## Vulnerability
Tieline IP Audio Gateway 2.6.4.8 and below is affected by a vulnerability in the web administrative interface that could allow an unauthenticated user to access a sensitive part of the system with a high privileged account. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the admin panel, potentially leading to unauthorized control and manipulation of the audio gateway.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-1188. Remediation: Upgrade to a patched version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/api/get_device_details` with a hardcoded Digest Authorization header (precomputed for default admin:password) and Referer header. It verifies success via HTTP 200 status, text/xml Content-Type header, and presence of both `<SERIAL>` and `<VERSION>` in the response body.
