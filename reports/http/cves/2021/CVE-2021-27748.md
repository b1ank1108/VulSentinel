## Vulnerability
IBM WebSphere HCL Digital Experience is vulnerable to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that impacts on-premise deployments and containers.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template uses a two-step flow:  
1. GET `/` (with host-redirects and max-redirects) to fingerprint the product via an internal matcher for the word "IBM WebSphere Portal".  
2. GET requests to `/docpicker/internal_proxy/http/oast.me` and `/wps/PA_WCM_Authoring_UI/proxy/http/oast.me` (with host-redirects and max-redirects, stop-at-first-match) that trigger the SSRF proxy to an interactsh domain. Detection succeeds if the response body contains the word "Interactsh Server".
