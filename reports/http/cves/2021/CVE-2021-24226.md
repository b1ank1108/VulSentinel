affected_product: WordPress AccessAlly plugin
severity: high
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: <3.5.7
preconditions: presence of the [accessally_order_form] shortcode on public-facing pages
poc_classification: info-leak
---

## Vulnerability
WordPress AccessAlly plugin before 3.5.7 leaks sensitive information. The shortcode `[accessally_order_form]` (handled by `resource/frontend/product/product-shortcode.php`) dumps `serialize($_SERVER)` containing all environment variables into the page body. Exploitation requires no authentication and affects any public page with the shortcode.

CVSS 3.1 score: 7.5 (High)  
Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  
CWE: 200 (Information Disclosure)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` and matches for the presence of the string `<div id="accessally-testing-data"` in the response body together with HTTP status 200. This confirms the vulnerable shortcode is active and the environment-variable dump is occurring.
