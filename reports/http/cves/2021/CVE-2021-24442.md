## Vulnerability
The Poll, Survey, Questionnaire and Voting system WordPress plugin (known as WordPress Polls Widget) before 1.5.3 fails to sanitise, escape or validate the `date_answers[]` POST parameter before using it in a SQL statement during poll result submission. This allows unauthenticated remote SQL injection (CWE-89). CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Impact includes full database manipulation and potential extraction of all WordPress data such as user credentials.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues a single time-based blind SQLi probe via POST `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=pollinsertvalues` containing `question_id=1&poll_answer_securety=8df73ed4ee&date_answers[0]=SLEEP(5)`. Detection matches on `duration>=5`, HTTP 200 status, and body containing `{"answer_name"` plus `"vote":` to confirm exploitable injection point that permits arbitrary database reads/writes.
