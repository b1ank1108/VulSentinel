## Vulnerability
Gryphon Tower router web interface contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the `url` parameter of the `/cgi-bin/luci/site_access/` page. An attacker can exploit this issue by tricking a user into following a specially crafted link, granting the attacker JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.

CVSS: 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE: CWE-79  
Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the affected website.  
Remediation: Upgrade to the latest version to mitigate this vulnerability.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/cgi-bin/luci/site_access/?url=%22%20onfocus=alert(document.domain)%20autofocus=1` and confirms the condition with an AND matcher: status code 200, `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and response body simultaneously contains both `'onfocus=alert(document.domain) autofocus=1>'` and `'Send Access Request URL'`. This verifies that the `url` parameter is reflected without sanitization, proving the reflected XSS flaw that enables client-side JavaScript execution and subsequent data exfiltration in the victim's browser context.
