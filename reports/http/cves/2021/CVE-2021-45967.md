## Vulnerability
Pascom CPS Server-Side Request Forgery (CVE-2021-45967) affects versions before 7.20 packaged with Cloud Phone System. The flaw is a server-side request forgery allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to force the server to initiate arbitrary requests (via the getFavicon endpoint). This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems, potentially leading to further exploitation or compromise. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-22.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/services/pluginscript/..;/..;/..;/getFavicon?host={{interactsh-url}}` (using path-traversal segments to reach the endpoint). It verifies exploitation by confirming a 200 status code together with an inbound HTTP interaction on the interactsh server, proving the target performed an attacker-controlled outbound request.
