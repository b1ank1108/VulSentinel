## Vulnerability
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the settings page of the WordPress Redirect 404 to Parent plugin (by mooveagency). The `tab` parameter is not sanitized before output in `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=moove-redirect-settings`, allowing JavaScript injection.

Authenticated administrators visiting a crafted malicious link will execute the attacker-controlled script in their browser context (CVSS 6.1). Potential impacts include administrator session cookie theft or unauthorized admin actions. Fixed in 1.3.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` using username/password credentials. It then sends a GET request to the vulnerable admin settings endpoint embedding a reflected XSS payload in the `tab` parameter (`%22+style%3Danimation-name%3Arotation+onanimationstart%3D%22alert(document.domain)%3B`). Detection succeeds if the response body reflects the unsanitized payload string and contains the plugin page title "Moove redirect 404".
