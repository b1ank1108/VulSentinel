## Vulnerability
Intelbras WIN 300 and WRN 342 router devices through 2021-01-04 expose the wireless password (`def_wirelesspassword`) in plaintext within the HTML source of the publicly accessible `/index.asp` page. 

This information disclosure allows unauthenticated remote attackers to retrieve Wi-Fi credentials, enabling unauthorized network access and potential further compromise of the administrative interface. CVSS 3.1 score: 7.5 (High) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. No user interaction or authentication is needed for exploitation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.asp`. It verifies the vulnerability by checking for the presence of both 'def_wirelesspassword =' and the page title '<title>Roteador Wireless</title>' in the response body (status 200). The template also extracts the credential value using regex: `def_wirelesspassword = "([A-Za-z0-9=]+)";`.
