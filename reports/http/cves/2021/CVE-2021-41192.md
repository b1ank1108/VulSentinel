affected_product: Redash
severity: medium
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: <=10.0
preconditions: without explicitly specifying the REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET or REDASH_SECRET_KEY environment variables
poc_classification: auth-bypass

## Vulnerability
Redash versions <=10.0 (and prior) use identical default values for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` when these environment variables are not explicitly configured during setup. This insecure default initialization (CWE-1188) allows any attacker to forge valid sessions using the publicly known defaults, enabling unauthorized access. CVSS 6.5 (Medium): AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. Impact includes potential full application compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends unauthenticated GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/reset/IjEi.YhAmmQ.cdQp7CnnVq02aQ05y8tSBddl-qs` (or the `/redash/reset/` variant) using a hardcoded token precomputed from the known default secret. It verifies exploitation conditions via an AND matcher on HTTP 200 status and response body containing both "Enter your new password:" and "redash". Positive match confirms default-secret usage and successful session-forgery capability.
