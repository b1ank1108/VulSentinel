## Vulnerability
Zyxel ZyWALL 2 Plus Internet Security Appliance contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Insecure URI handling leads to bypass of security restrictions, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript codes to perform multiple attacks.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/Forms/rpAuth_1?id=</form><iMg%20src=x%20onerror="prompt(document.domain)"><form>`. Detection relies on matching the exact unsanitized payload reflected in the response body alongside the string 'Entry Error', combined with HTTP 200 status and text/html Content-Type header. This confirms lack of input sanitization for reflected XSS.
