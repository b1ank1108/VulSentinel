## Vulnerability
Jeecg Boot <= 2.4.5 exposes the API endpoint `/jeecg-boot/sys/user/querySysUser` with no authentication, allowing any unauthenticated remote attacker to leak sensitive user details (email, phone) and enumerate existing usernames.  
CVSS: 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) | CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource).  
Impact: direct access to PII and account enumeration that can enable further attacks.  
Remediation: upgrade to 2.4.6 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/jeecg-boot/sys/user/querySysUser?username=admin` and confirms exposure when the response meets all three conditions simultaneously: HTTP 200, `Content-Type: application/json`, and JSON body containing `"username":"admin"`, `"success":true`, and `"result":{`.
