## Vulnerability
VMware Workspace ONE UEM console contains a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CWE-918, CVSS 7.5). Versions 20.0.8 prior to 20.0.8.37, 20.11.0 prior to 20.11.0.40, 21.2.0 prior to 21.2.0.27, and 21.5.0 prior to 21.5.0.37 are affected. An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the console can force the server to send crafted requests to internal or external resources, resulting in information disclosure or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `/Catalog/BlobHandler.ashx` with a base64-encoded `Url` parameter crafted to trigger an SSRF callback to an interactsh server. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 status combined with the presence of the string "Interactsh Server" in the response body.
