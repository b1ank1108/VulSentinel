## Vulnerability
A local file inclusion vulnerability exists in BIQS IT Biqs-drive v1.83 and below when sending a specific payload as the file parameter to download/index.php. This allows the attacker to read arbitrary files from the server with the permissions of the configured web-user.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score: 7.5)

Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, remote code execution, and potential compromise of the entire system.

Remediation: Upgrade to the latest version of BIQS IT Biqs-drive (v1.84 or higher) which includes a fix for the Local File Inclusion vulnerability.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/download/index.php?file=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` and matches on HTTP status 200 combined with the regex pattern `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body to verify successful inclusion of `/etc/passwd`.
