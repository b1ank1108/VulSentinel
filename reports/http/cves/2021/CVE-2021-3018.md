## Vulnerability
IPeakCMS 3.5 (ipeak Infosystems ibexwebCMS 3.5) contains an unauthenticated Boolean-based SQL injection in `/cms/print.php` due to unsanitized `id` parameter. Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands with no authentication required, resulting in data disclosure, tampering, or full database compromise. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8), CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template uses a two-request HTTP flow to verify the flaw.  
1. GET `/cms/` (internal matcher) checks status 200 and body contains both "ipeak" and "webCMS-3.5" to fingerprint the exact vulnerable version.  
2. GET `/cms/print.php?id=1%20AND%207334=BENCHMARK(8000000,MD5(0x73636a72))` (30s timeout) checks duration ≥8s, status 200, and body contains `onLoad="print();"` to confirm time-based blind SQL injection.
