## Vulnerability
Keycloak 10.0.0 to 18.0.0 is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw (CWE-79) in the client-registrations endpoint. Unsanitized unknown attribute names from POST JSON bodies are echoed verbatim into 400 error responses served with `Content-Type: text/html`, causing the browser to interpret and execute the payload. The issue exists on any configured realm (including master) and requires no authentication.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context, enabling session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a POST request containing the JSON body `{"Test<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>":1}` (with `Content-Type: application/json`) to four endpoint variants under the master realm: `/auth/realms/master/clients-registrations/default`, `/auth/realms/master/clients-registrations/openid-connect`, `/realms/master/clients-registrations/default`, and `/realms/master/clients-registrations/openid-connect`. It stops at the first match and confirms the vulnerability if the response meets all three conditions simultaneously: HTTP 400 status, the exact unsanitized payload string present in the body, and `text/html` in the Content-Type header.
