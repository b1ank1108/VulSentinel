## Vulnerability
Prometheus 2.23.0 through 2.26.0 and 2.27.0 is affected by an open redirect (CWE-601) in the legacy `/new` UI transition endpoint. A crafted URL of the form `/new/<arbitrary-scheme-and-host>` causes an unvalidated redirect in the `Location` response header. CVSS 3.1 score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Exploitation requires only that a victim click a malicious link; no server-side state is altered and no credentials are needed.

**Impact**  
Attacker-controlled redirect enables phishing, credential theft, or chaining to other client-side attacks, potentially resulting in sensitive-information disclosure or unauthorized user actions.

**Remediation**  
Upgrade to 2.26.1 / 2.27.1 (or any 2.28.0+ where `/new` is fully removed). Workaround: block `/new` paths at a reverse proxy.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues one unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/new/newhttp://interact.sh` and inspects the `Location` response header with the regex `(?m)^(?:Location\s*?:\s*?)(?:https?://|//)?(?:[a-zA-Z0-9\-_\.@]*)interact\.sh.*$`. A match confirms the open-redirect behavior is present.
