## Vulnerability
Spotweb <= 1.5.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in `templates/installer/step-004.inc.php`. The `lastname` parameter (submitted via POST to `/install.php?page=4`) is unsanitized, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML.  

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Impact includes client-side data theft, session hijacking, and defacement for any user viewing the affected installer page. Fixed in version 1.5.2.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated POST request to `/install.php?page=4` with the form field `settingsform[lastname]=pdteam'+onclick='alert(document.domain)`. It verifies the vulnerability by checking that the response body simultaneously contains the unsanitized payload string, the word "Spotweb", has Content-Type text/html, and returns HTTP 200.
