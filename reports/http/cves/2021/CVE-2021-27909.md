## Vulnerability

Mautic before 3.3.4 suffers from a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `bundle` parameter on the password reset page (`/passwordreset`).

An attacker can supply a malicious URL parameter to inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser context when the link is visited.

**Description:** Mautic before 3.3.4 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability on the password reset page in the bundle parameter of the URL. An attacker can inject arbitrary script, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and/or launch other attacks.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, leading to potential data theft or unauthorized actions.

**Remediation:** Upgrade Mautic to version 3.3.4 or later.

**CVSS:** 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
**CWE:** CWE-79  
**CPE:** cpe:2.3:a:acquia:mautic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request with a proof-of-concept XSS payload in the `bundle` query parameter: `';alert(document.domain);var+ok='`. It then checks for reflection of this exact string in the page body (alongside `mauticBasePath` to fingerprint Mautic), HTTP status 200, and `text/html` content-type.

This confirms the parameter is reflected without sanitization or encoding, proving the reflected XSS condition.
