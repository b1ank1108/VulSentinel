## Vulnerability
Sidekiq through 5.1.3 and 6.x through 6.2.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability via unsanitized queue name in the live-poll feature when Internet Explorer is used.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)  
CWE-79

Impact: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or session hijacking.  
Remediation: Upgrade to Sidekiq version 6.2.0 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a login POST to `/api/auth` with supplied username/password credentials, followed by a GET request to `/queues/"onmouseover="alert(document.domain)"`. It verifies the XSS payload and the string "sidekiq" appear unescaped in the response body (case-insensitive), the `Content-Type` header contains "text/html", and the status code is 200.
