## Vulnerability

WordPress Ocean Extra plugin before version 1.9.5 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not escape generated links, which are then reflected when the OceanWP theme is active. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement. Fixed in 1.9.5.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first authenticates by POSTing {{username}} and {{password}} to /wp-login.php (with wordpress_test_cookie), then issues a GET to /wp-admin/?step=demo&page=owp_setup&a"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>. It verifies the XSS condition if the body simultaneously contains 'OceanWP' and the unescaped payload '><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>', the header contains text/html, and status is 200.
