## Vulnerability
Telesquare TLR-2005KSH 1.0.0 is affected by an incorrect access control vulnerability. The PUT HTTP method is enabled without restrictions, allowing unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files (including HTML and CGI formats) directly to the web root.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template executes a three-step raw HTTP sequence against a randomly generated filename (`{{randstr}}.txt`):
- Initial GET expects 404 (file does not exist)
- PUT uploads the literal string "CVE-2021-45428" and expects 201 Created
- Final GET expects 200 OK with the uploaded string present in the body

Matchers enforce all three conditions via DSL. The probe itself performs a harmless file write/read test; the underlying flaw (unrestricted PUT) enables full remote code execution by uploading and invoking CGI scripts.
