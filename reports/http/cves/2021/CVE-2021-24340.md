## Vulnerability
Unauthenticated time-based blind SQL injection (CWE-89) in the WP Statistics plugin (veronalabs/wp_statistics) for WordPress.  
Versions prior to 13.0.8 allow remote attackers to extract arbitrary database contents (configuration, users, posts, etc.) by injecting payloads into the `ID` parameter of the `wps_pages_page` admin endpoint.  
CVSS 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). No authentication or user interaction required; plugin installation alone is sufficient.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first fetches `/wp-content/plugins/wp-statistics/readme.txt` and confirms the plugin is present (status 200 and body contains "WP Statistics"). It then issues a second GET to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wps_pages_page&ID=0+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(7)))test)&type=home` (15 s timeout). Vulnerability is confirmed when the second response duration is ≥7 s, returns status 500, and body contains both `>WordPress &rsaquo; Error<` and `>Your request is not valid.<`.
