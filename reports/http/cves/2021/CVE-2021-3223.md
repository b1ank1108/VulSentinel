## Vulnerability
Node RED Dashboard before 2.26.2 is vulnerable to local file inclusion via directory traversal in the `/ui_base/js/..%2f` endpoint. Unauthenticated remote attackers can read arbitrary server files (e.g. `/etc/passwd`, `settings.js`) containing sensitive data such as credentials and configuration.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5)  
CWE-22 (Path Traversal)  
Impact: exposure of configuration files, credentials, and other sensitive server data.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the flaw with two unauthenticated GET requests using chained `..%2f` traversal payloads:  
- `{{BaseURL}}/ui_base/js/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd` (matches regex `root:.*:0:0:`)  
- `{{BaseURL}}/ui_base/js/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fsettings.js` (matches word `Node-RED web server is listening`)  

Matchers-condition OR; positive match on either confirms the LFI.
