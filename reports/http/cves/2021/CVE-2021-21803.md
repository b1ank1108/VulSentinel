## Vulnerability
Advantech R-SeeNet is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting via the `device_graph_page.php` script through the unsanitized `is2sim` parameter. A specially crafted URL containing a JavaScript payload, when visited by a victim, leads to arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the victim's browser context.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow session hijacking, website defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

**CVSS:** 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CWE:** CWE-79

**Remediation:** Apply the latest security patches or updates provided by Advantech.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/php/device_graph_page.php?is2sim=%22zlo%20onerror=alert(1)%20%22`. It confirms the reflected XSS by matching the exact unsanitized payload string `"zlo onerror=alert(1) "` together with `Device Status Graph` in the response body, plus `text/html` in the Content-Type header and HTTP status 200.
