## Vulnerability
SolarWinds Serv-U 15.3 is susceptible to local file inclusion, which may allow an attacker access to installation and server files and also make it possible to obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing for further attacks. Resolved in Serv-U 15.3 Hotfix 1.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). CWE-22.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw POST request to `/?Command=NOOP&InternalFile=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../Windows/win.ini&NewWebClient=1` (with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` body containing the same path) and confirms the vulnerability if the response body matches the regex for win.ini section headers (`\[(font|extension|file)s\]`) while returning HTTP status 401.
