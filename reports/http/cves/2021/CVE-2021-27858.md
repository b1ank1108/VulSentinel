## Vulnerability
FatPipe WARP, IPVPN, and MPVPN software prior to versions 10.1.2r60p91 and 10.2.2r42 contain a missing authorization (CWE-862) caused by lack of access control in the web management interface, letting remote attackers access sensitive URLs. Exploit requires no authentication. Unauthenticated attackers can access sensitive management interface URLs and obtain device information (product type, version) due to missing authorization checks. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (5.3).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues an unauthenticated GET request to `/fpui/jsp/index.jsp` and verifies exposure via HTTP 200 status combined with presence of "productType", "type:", "version:", and "<title>FatPipe Networks</title>" in the response body (AND condition). It extracts the firmware version via regex `version: "([0-9.a-z]+)"` from the body.
