## Vulnerability
FatPipe WARP, IPVPN, and MPVPN software prior to versions 10.1.2r60p91 and 10.2.2r42 contain a hardcoded backdoor account "cmuser" with administrative privileges and an empty password. Unauthenticated remote attackers can log in directly, achieving full device compromise (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, score 9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues a single POST request to `/fpui/loginServlet` with `loginParams={"username":"cmuser","password":"","authType":0}`. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200, `Content-Type: application/json` header, and JSON body containing both `"loginRes":"success"` and `"activeUserName":"cmuser"`.
