## Vulnerability
Buffalo WSR-2533DHPL2 firmware versions <= 1.02 and WSR-2533DHP3 firmware versions <= 1.24 are affected by a path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22, CVE-2021-20090) in the web interface. Unauthenticated remote attackers can exploit this to bypass authentication and read sensitive files including configuration files and credentials. CVSS 3.1 score: 9.8 (Critical).

## PoC / Detection
