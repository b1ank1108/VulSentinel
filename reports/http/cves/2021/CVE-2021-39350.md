## Vulnerability
FV Flowplayer Video Player WordPress plugin is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `player_id` parameter in `~/view/stats.php`. Versions 7.5.0.727 - 7.5.2.727 are affected. Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first logs in via POST to `/wp-login.php` using `{{username}}` and `{{password}}`. It follows with a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=fv_player_stats&player_id=1</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. Matches on the body containing the echoed payload and `"<h1>FV Player Stats</h1>"`, `text/html` header, and status 200 to confirm unsanitized reflection.
