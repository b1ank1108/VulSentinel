## Vulnerability
CVE-2021-41826 is an open redirection vulnerability in PlaceOS Authentication Service before 1.29.10.0 located in app/controllers/auth/sessions_controller.rb. The logout endpoint accepts an unvalidated `continue` parameter that is reflected directly in the Location header, allowing an attacker-supplied URL (including external domains) to be used for redirection. CVSS 3.1 score is 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), CWE-601. Impact includes phishing campaigns and credential theft by redirecting users to attacker-controlled sites. Remediation requires updating to PlaceOS 1.2109.2 or higher.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/auth/logout?continue=//interact.sh`. It matches on HTTP status 301 or 302 combined with a Location header containing the interact.sh domain, confirming the endpoint performs an open redirect to the supplied value.
