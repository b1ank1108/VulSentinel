## Vulnerability
WordPress Stop Spammers plugin before 2021.9 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The plugin fails to escape user input when blocking requests (such as matching a spam word), outputting the input in an HTML attribute after sanitizing only HTML tags.

CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Successful exploitation allows malicious script injection into pages viewed by other users, enabling theft of sensitive information or unauthorized client-side actions.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first fingerprints the plugin via a GET to `/wp-content/plugins/stop-spammer-registrations-plugin/readme.txt`, internally matching the strings "Stop Spammers Spam Prevention" and "Tags:". It then issues a POST to `/wp-login.php` (with `wordpress_test_cookie` set) embedding the XSS payload `ad" accesskey=X onclick=alert(1)` in the `log` username field. Detection succeeds if the response body reflects the exact unescaped payload string, returns status 200, and has `text/html` content-type.

This confirms unsafe reflection occurs in the plugin's spam-blocking response path on the public login endpoint.
