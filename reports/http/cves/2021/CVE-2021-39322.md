## Vulnerability
WordPress Easy Social Icons Plugin <= 3.0.8 echoes raw `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` in its main file without sanitization. On Apache+modPHP configurations this enables reflected XSS via malicious code injected into the request path (e.g. `/wp-admin/admin.php/...</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>/?page=cnss_social_icon_page`). CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1, Medium). CWE-79. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in an authenticated administrator's browser context, enabling data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first sends a POST to `/wp-login.php` with `log={{username}}&pwd={{password}}` to establish an authenticated session, then issues a GET to the crafted admin URL containing the XSS payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. It verifies exploitation by checking that the exact payload appears unsanitized in the response body, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and HTTP status is 200.
