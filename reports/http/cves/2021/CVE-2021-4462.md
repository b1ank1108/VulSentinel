## Vulnerability
Employee Records System 1.0 contains an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in uploadID.php that allows remote unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary PHP files and achieve remote code execution. Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary PHP files via uploadID.php and achieve remote code execution, leading to complete server compromise.

CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) | CWE-434

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs a POST multipart/form-data request to `/dashboard/uploadID.php` (X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest, Content-Type image/png) uploading a PHP payload `<?php echo md5("CVE-2021-4462");unlink(__FILE__); ?>` saved under a random `{{rand_base(5)}}.php` filename. It extracts `upload_filename` via regex from the JSON response body, then issues a GET to `/uploads/employees_ids/{{upload_filename}}` and matches `status_code_2 == 200 && contains(body_2, md5_hash)` to confirm code execution.
