## Vulnerability
Telesquare TLR-2855KS6 firmware is vulnerable to an unauthorized arbitrary file deletion issue. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files (including system files and scripts) on the device by issuing HTTP DELETE requests to paths under /cgi-bin/. 

This can render the device inoperable by destroying critical components. CVSS v3.1 score is 9.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H). Remediation requires firmware updates or restricting DELETE method access.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template detects the vulnerability by performing two raw HTTP requests: first a PUT to /cgi-bin/{{rand_base(6)}}.txt to create a file with random content (verifying 201 status), followed by a DELETE to the same path (verifying 204 status). It additionally matches for the presence of "lighttpd" in the Server header. Success confirms the server permits unauthenticated file creation and deletion, proving the arbitrary file deletion flaw.
