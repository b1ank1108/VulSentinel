## Vulnerability
CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller is susceptible to unauthenticated information disclosure (CVE-2021-33221, CWE-306) because the `/service/v1/service-details` API endpoint returns system and configuration data without any authentication. Leaked information includes DNS and NTP servers, internal hostname, IoT Controller version, and—on fully configured production devices—potentially sensitive items such as API keys and tokens.

**CVSS 3.1:** 9.8 (Critical)  
**Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  
**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration and credentials, enabling follow-on attacks or unauthorized access.  
**Remediation:** Apply latest CommScope patches (advisory ID 20210525).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/service/v1/service-details` and confirms the vulnerability with an AND matcher set:  
- Header contains `application/json`  
- Status code 200  
- Body contains all words: `message`, `ok`, `data`, `dns`, `gateway`  

This verifies the endpoint is active and leaking the expected service-details JSON.
