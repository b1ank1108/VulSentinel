## Vulnerability
Spotweb <= 1.5.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `templates/installer/step-004.inc.php` via the `newpassword2` parameter. Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML through a POST request to the installation form at `/install.php?page=4`.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context, resulting in data theft or unauthorized actions. Fixed in version 1.5.2.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw POST request to `/install.php?page=4` with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and body `settingsform[newpassword2]=pdteam'+onclick='alert(document.domain)`. It verifies the vulnerability if the response body contains both the unsanitized payload string `"onclick='alert(document.domain)"` and `"Spotweb"`, returns HTTP 200, and has `text/html` content-type.
