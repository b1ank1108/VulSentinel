## Vulnerability
Specially crafted `X-Forwarded-Host` headers in combination with certain "allowed host" formats cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website.  
Impact: phishing attacks where users are tricked into visiting malicious sites and disclosing sensitive information.  
Remediation: apply latest vendor security patches or updates.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1)  
CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only  
The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/` with header `X-Forwarded-Host: //interact.sh`. It matches on 301/302/307/308 status codes where the `Location` header contains a redirect to the `interact.sh` domain (regex: `(?m)^(?:Location\s*?:\s*?)(?:https?:\/\/|\/\/|\/\\\\|\/\\)(?:[a-zA-Z0-9\-_\.@]*)interact\.sh\/?(\/|[^.].*)?$`).
