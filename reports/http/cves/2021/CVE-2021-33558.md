affected_product: Boa
severity: high
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: 0.94.13

## Vulnerability
Boa 0.94.13 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a misconfiguration involving backup.html, preview.html, js/log.js, log.html, email.html, online-users.html, and config.js. NOTE: multiple third parties report that this is a site-specific issue because those files are not part of Boa. Unauthenticated attackers can access sensitive JavaScript files exposing logging functionality and potentially other configuration details.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). Remediation: update to a version newer than 0.94.13 or apply vendor patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/js/log.js` and matches HTTP status 200 together with both words "function SearchLog" and "logTime" (case-insensitive) present in the response body.
