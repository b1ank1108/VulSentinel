## Vulnerability

Telesquare TLR-2005KSH 1.0.0 firmware suffers from an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability. A remote unauthenticated attacker can send an HTTP DELETE request to any file path and delete arbitrary files, including critical system-internal files. Successful exploitation can cause permanent loss of critical data or complete system instability.

**CVSS v3.1**: 9.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE-ID**: CWE-306  
**Vendor/Product**: telesquare / tlr-2005ksh_firmware  

## PoC / Detection

Classification: state-change

The template performs an intrusive verification by targeting the test file `/images/icons_title.gif`:
- Initial GET confirms the file exists (status_code == 200).
- DELETE request removes the file (status_code == 204).
- Follow-up GET confirms successful deletion (status_code == 404).

This directly demonstrates that the web server accepts unauthenticated DELETE requests allowing arbitrary file-system modification.
