## Vulnerability
ZEROF Web Server 1.0 (April 2021) contains an SQL Injection vulnerability (CWE-89) via the `/HandleEvent` endpoint used by the login page. Unauthenticated attackers can inject and execute arbitrary SQL queries against the backend database.

Impact includes unauthorized access to sensitive data, data leakage, and data manipulation. CVSS 3.1 score: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first sends a GET request to `/` to fingerprint the ZEROF Web Server (checks for title and extracts `_S_ID` session value from JavaScript) and then issues a POST request to `/HandleEvent` with a crafted payload injecting a single quote (`'`) into the SQL query. It verifies exploitation conditions by matching for the MySQL-style error message "You have an error in your SQL syntax" in the body, "ZEROF" in headers, and HTTP 200 status. This confirms error-based SQL injection without performing data exfiltration.
