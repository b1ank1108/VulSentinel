## Vulnerability
Cyberoam NetGenie C0101B1-20141120-NG11VO devices through 2021-08-14 are susceptible to reflected cross-site scripting via the 'u' parameter of ft.php.

**CVSS:** 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
**CWE:** CWE-79  

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.  

Remediation requires applying the latest security patches or firmware updates provided by the vendor.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/tweb/ft.php?u=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` containing a reflected XSS payload and verifies the flaw by checking that the unsanitized string `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` appears in the response body, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
