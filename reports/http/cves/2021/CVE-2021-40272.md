## Vulnerability
IRTS OP5 Monitor versions 8.3.1, 8.3.2, and 8.3.3 suffer from a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the API help endpoint permits injection of arbitrary JavaScript code through specially crafted URL paths.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (CWE-79). Exploitation may result in execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser, facilitating data theft or unauthorized actions.

Remediation involves updating to a patched version of the software.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The detection issues a raw GET request embedding the XSS test payload `onmouseover=alert(document.domain)` into `/api/help'onmouseover=alert(document.domain)/'/;/beta/license`. Matchers validate successful reflection by searching for the payload string in the body, alongside "op5 monitor" or "itrs" keywords, text/html content-type, and HTTP status 401. This confirms reflected XSS without authentication or external interaction.
