## Vulnerability
BeyondTrust Secure Remote Access Base through 6.0.1 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the appliance login page.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Impact includes session hijacking, data theft, or defacement when arbitrary JavaScript executes in the victim's browser. Remediation requires upgrading to version 6.0.2 or higher.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single GET request to /appliance/login.ns with a reflected XSS payload (`<svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`) injected into the login[password] parameter. It matches for unsanitized reflection of the payload in the body (plus "bomgar" string) and HTTP 200 to confirm the vulnerability.
