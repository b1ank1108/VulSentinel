affected_product: Auerswald COMpact 5500R

## Vulnerability
Auerswald COMpact 5500R devices running firmware 7.8A and 8.0B expose an unauthenticated backdoor endpoint at `/about_state`. This grants direct access to a restricted web management interface, enabling attackers to reset the administrator password and achieve full device control.

**Impact:** Unauthenticated attackers can gain unauthorized access to affected devices.  
**CVSS:** 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**Remediation:** Apply the latest firmware update provided by Auerswald.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/about_state` and matches on:
- status code 200
- `Content-Type` header containing `application/json`
- response body containing all three strings: `"pbx"`, `"dongleStatus":0`, and `"macaddr"`

This harmless fingerprint confirms the presence of the backdoor endpoint.
