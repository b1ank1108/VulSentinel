## Vulnerability
Easy Social Feed < 6.2.7 WordPress plugin is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the admin dashboard. The `type` parameter on `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=easy-facebook-likebox` is not sanitized or escaped before being output, allowing JavaScript injection that executes with the privileges of a logged-in administrator or editor.

**CVSS 3.1 Score:** 6.1 (Medium) | **Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N | **CWE-79**

**Impact:** Malicious JS can steal admin session cookies or alter social feed configurations.

**Remediation:** Update to Easy Social Feed version 6.2.7 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template authenticates to WordPress via POST to `/wp-login.php` with provided `{{username}}`/`{{password}}`, then sends a GET request to the vulnerable admin endpoint injecting the breakout payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the `type` parameter. It verifies exploitation conditions by checking for exact unsanitized reflection of the payload in the response body (embedded as `'type' : '</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>'`), along with HTTP 200 and text/html content-type. This confirms reflected XSS without sanitization.
