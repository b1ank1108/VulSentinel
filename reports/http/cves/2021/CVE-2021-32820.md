## Vulnerability
Express-handlebars is susceptible to local file inclusion because it mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extensions (i.e., file.extension) can be included. Files that lack an extension will have .handlebars appended to them.

Impact: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or sensitive information disclosure.

Remediation: Update to the latest version of Express-handlebars to mitigate the vulnerability.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 8.6)  
CWE: CWE-94, CWE-200

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/?layout=/etc/passwd` and verifies exploitation by matching the response body against /etc/passwd content patterns (`root:.*:0:0:`, `daemon:[x*]:0:0:`, `operator:[x*]:0:0:`) under `status: 200`.
