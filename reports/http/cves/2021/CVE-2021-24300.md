## Vulnerability
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in PickPlugins Product Slider for WooCommerce (WordPress plugin) versions before 1.13.22. The flaw resides in the slider import search feature because the `keyword` GET parameter on `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=wcps&page=import_layouts` is not sanitized before being reflected in an HTML attribute.

Successful exploitation (requires tricking an authenticated admin into visiting a crafted URL) allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context, enabling session hijacking, sensitive data exfiltration (e.g. cookies), or page defacement. CVSS 3.1 score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N); template requires admin login despite PR:N rating.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a POST to `/wp-login.php` with `log={{username}}&pwd={{password}}` to establish an authenticated session, then sends a GET request to the vulnerable admin endpoint with `keyword="onmouseover=alert(document.domain);//`. Detection succeeds when the response body contains the exact unsanitized payload inside a `value` attribute (alongside the string "PickPlugins Product Slider"), returns status 200, and has `text/html` Content-Type.
