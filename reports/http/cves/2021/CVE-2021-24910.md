## Vulnerability
WordPress Transposh Translation plugin before 1.0.8 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (CWE-79, CVSS 6.1). The `a` parameter (tested via `q`) is not sanitized and escaped via the `tp_tp` AJAX action before being output in the response. The endpoint is reachable by both unauthenticated and authenticated users when the curl library is installed.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tp_tp&e=g&m=s&tl=en&q=<img%20src%3dx%20onerror%3dalert(document.domain)>`. It verifies exploitation by confirming the raw payload string and `{"result":` both appear unsanitized in the response body, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
