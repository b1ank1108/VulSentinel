## Vulnerability
WordPress JNews Theme before 8.0.6 is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. The `cat_id` parameter is not sanitized in POST requests to `/?ajax-request=jnews` (when `action=jnews_build_mega_category_*`). CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1, CWE-79). Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the context of the victim’s browser, enabling data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET request to `/wp-content/themes/jnews/readme.txt` and internally matches the strings "Change Log:" and "JNews -" to fingerprint the vulnerable theme. It then issues a POST request to `/?ajax-request=jnews` containing the reflected payload `cat_id=6"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` together with `action=jnews_build_mega_category_2`. Vulnerability is confirmed if the response body contains the unsanitized payload string, the `Content-Type` header is `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
