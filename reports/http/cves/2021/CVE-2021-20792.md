## Vulnerability
WordPress Quiz and Survey Master plugin versions prior to 7.1.14 is affected by a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2021-20792, CWE-79). A remote attacker can inject arbitrary scripts via unspecified vectors, observed in the search and pagination parameters of the quizzes management admin page (`page=mlw_quiz_list`).

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1 - Medium). 

Impact includes potential data theft, session hijacking, and website defacement through malicious script execution.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a login to WordPress admin using provided `{{username}}` and `{{password}}` via POST to `/wp-login.php`. It follows with a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mlw_quiz_list` embedding the payload `"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in `s` and `paged` parameters. It verifies exploitation by checking for unescaped payload reflection in the HTML body (along with 200 status and text/html content-type).
