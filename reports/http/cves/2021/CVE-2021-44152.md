## Vulnerability

Reprise License Manager (RLM) 14.2 fails to verify authentication or authorization for critical functions, specifically allowing unauthenticated users to change the password of any existing user account (CVE-2021-44152, CWE-306). 

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8 Critical). 

Impact includes full authentication bypass and unauthorized administrative access to the license management system. Remediation requires applying the latest security patch or upgrading to a patched version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues an unauthenticated GET request to `/goforms/menu` and matches for the presence of "RLM Administration Commands" in the response body with HTTP 200 status. This detects exposure of the administrative interface without requiring credentials, confirming the vulnerable state where password changes can be performed by anyone.
