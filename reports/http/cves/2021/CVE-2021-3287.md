## Vulnerability
Zoho ManageEngine OpManager before 12.5.329 contains a remote code execution vulnerability caused by a bypass in the Java deserialization class (CWE-502). Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code remotely, leading to full system compromise. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Impact includes complete host takeover.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` (following up to 3 redirects) and performs passive fingerprinting: it verifies HTTP 200 status, confirms the body contains the string "ManageEngine", extracts the version with regex `cachestart\/([0-9.]+)\/cacheend`, then applies a DSL matcher `compare_versions(version, '< 125329', '>= 125000')` to identify affected builds. No payload is sent; detection is purely version-based.
