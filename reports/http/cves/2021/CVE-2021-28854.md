## Vulnerability
VICIdial's Web Client exposes multiple sensitive files directly from the client side. Accessible files include mysqli error logs, authentication logs, debug information, and records of successful/unsuccessful login attempts containing IP addresses, User-Agents, and credentials. This constitutes an information-disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2021-28854) that can be leveraged for further system compromise.

Impact: Unauthorized access to user credentials and customer data.  
Remediation: Apply latest VICIdial security patches to protect sensitive files.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/agc/vicidial_mysqli_errors.txt`. It confirms the vulnerability when the server returns HTTP status 200, a Content-Type header containing `text/plain`, and the response body contains the string `vdc_db_query` (a marker from the exposed mysqli error log).
