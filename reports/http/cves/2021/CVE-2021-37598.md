## Vulnerability
WP Cerber WordPress security plugin versions < 8.9.3 contains a broken access control flaw in `/wp-json` REST API handling. Appending a trailing `?` bypasses the plugin's protection on the endpoint, permitting unauthenticated users to reach otherwise restricted REST API paths. Root cause is improper trailing-character sanitization. Impact: information disclosure or chained attacks on exposed endpoints. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (5.3). CWE-863. Fixed in 8.9.3+.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects the bypass via two sequential HTTP GET requests:  
1. `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json` (expects 403/404 internally to confirm protection is active).  
2. `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json?` (expects 200 OK, `application/json` Content-Type, and JSON body containing all of `"name":`, `"url":`, `"home":`, `"description":`).
