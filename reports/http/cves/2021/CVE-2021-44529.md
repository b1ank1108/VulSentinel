## Vulnerability
Ivanti EPM Cloud Services Appliance (CSA) before version 4.6.0-512 contains a code injection flaw (CWE-94) that lets an unauthenticated remote attacker execute arbitrary PHP code as the limited-privilege `nobody` user.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8).  
Successful exploitation results in remote code execution and potential full system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template performs a single unauthenticated GET to `/client/index.php` with the `Cookie` header `ab=ab; c=cGhwaW5mbygpOw==; d=; e=;` (where `c` is base64-encoded `phpinfo();`). It confirms exploitation when the response status is 200 and the body simultaneously contains the strings `phpinfo()` and `Cloud Services Appliance`.
