cve_id: CVE-2018-1000226
template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2018/CVE-2018-1000226.yaml
affected_product: Cobbler
severity: critical
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: 2.6.11+ (at least 2.0.0+, possibly older)
preconditions: Network access to the XMLRPC API endpoint (/cobbler_api)
poc_classification: auth-bypass
---

## Vulnerability
Cobbler XMLRPC API suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability due to improper validation of security tokens in API endpoints. Unauthenticated attackers can invoke privileged methods on the /cobbler_api endpoint (e.g. token generation), resulting in full API access leading to privilege escalation, arbitrary data manipulation/exfiltration, and LDAP credential harvesting. This is distinct from CVE-2018-10931. Affects Cobbler versions 2.6.11 and above, with code inspection indicating impact from at least 2.0.0 and potentially earlier versions. Exploitation requires only network connectivity. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs detection by issuing a raw POST request to `{{BaseURL}}/cobbler_api` with an XML-RPC payload invoking the internal method `_CobblerXMLRPCInterface__make_token` (parameter value "cobbler"). Success is verified via matchers confirming HTTP 200 status, `Content-Type: text/xml` header, presence of `<methodResponse>` (no `<name>faultCode</name>`), and regex extraction of a token string matching the pattern `(.*[a-zA-Z0-9].+==)</string></value>`.
