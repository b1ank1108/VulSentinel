## Vulnerability
DedeCMS 5.7 (cpe:2.3:a:dedecms:dedecms:5.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*) is affected by a path disclosure vulnerability (CWE-668, CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N score 7.5). Remote unauthenticated attackers can obtain the full server installation path by issuing direct requests to include/downmix.inc.php or inc/inc_archives_functions.php. Impact: disclosed path enables targeted reconnaissance and chaining with other vulnerabilities. Remediation: apply latest patch or upgrade to a fixed version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/include/downmix.inc.php` and matches on HTTP 200 status together with both strings "downmix.inc.php" and "Call to undefined function helper()" present in the response body (the latter revealing the PHP include error containing the absolute path).
