## Vulnerability
DomainMOD 4.11.01 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability via assets/add/account-owner.php Owner name field.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 4.8)  
CWE-79  
Remediation: Upgrade to the latest version of DomainMOD or apply the vendor-provided patch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template logs in via POST / using supplied credentials, submits the stored XSS payload `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the `new_owner` field to /assets/add/account-owner.php, then issues GET /assets/account-owners.php and confirms the script tag appears unsanitized in the response body (status 200, text/html, exact string match).
