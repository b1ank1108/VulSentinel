## Vulnerability

CVE-2018-20824 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WallboardServlet resource of Atlassian Jira versions prior to 7.13.1. The vulnerability exists in the `cyclePeriod` parameter, which fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it in the HTTP response. Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code through this parameter, which executes in the context of a victim's browser session when they visit a malicious link.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.0 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). The attack vector is network-based with low attack complexity, requires no privileges but does require user interaction, and has a changed scope with low impact to confidentiality and integrity.

Successful exploitation could lead to session hijacking, credential theft, defacement of the Jira interface, or execution of actions on behalf of authenticated users. The vulnerability affects the WallboardServlet endpoint, specifically the dashboard wallboard functionality.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the `/plugins/servlet/Wallboard/` endpoint with a crafted `cyclePeriod` parameter containing a JavaScript payload: `alert(document.domain)`. The template includes a `dashboardId` parameter set to 10000 (a common default dashboard ID in Jira installations).

The detection mechanism verifies the vulnerability by:
1. Checking if the injected payload appears in the response body with the pattern `timeout: alert(document.domain)`, indicating the JavaScript code was reflected without proper sanitization
2. Confirming the server returns a 200 OK status code

Both conditions must be met for a positive detection. The template uses a harmless proof-of-concept payload that would trigger a browser alert dialog if executed, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability without causing damage.
