## Vulnerability

vBulletin versions 3.x.x and 4.2.x through 4.2.5 contain an open redirect vulnerability in the `redirector.php` component. The vulnerability exists in the URL parameter handling, specifically through the `url` parameter (and optionally the `do=nodelay` parameter combination). This flaw is classified as CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site).

An attacker can craft malicious URLs that leverage the vulnerable redirector to redirect users to arbitrary external websites. This can be exploited for phishing attacks, credential harvesting, or malware distribution by making malicious links appear to originate from a trusted vBulletin forum domain. The vulnerability requires no authentication and can be triggered through simple GET requests.

The CVSS v3.0 score is 6.1 (Medium), with the vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation with low complexity, no privileges required, but requiring user interaction. The scope is changed, with low impact to confidentiality and integrity.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending GET requests to two variations of the vulnerable endpoint:
1. `/redirector.php?url=https://interact.sh`
2. `/redirector.php?do=nodelay&url=https://interact.sh`

The detection mechanism verifies the presence of an open redirect by checking for:
- A meta refresh tag in the response body that redirects to the attacker-controlled URL: `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=https://interact.sh">`
- An HTTP 200 status code response

The template uses `interact.sh` as a benign test domain to confirm that the application accepts and processes arbitrary external URLs in the redirect parameter. A successful match indicates the application will redirect users to any URL specified in the `url` parameter without proper validation.
