template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2018/CVE-2018-11759.yaml
affected_product: Apache Tomcat JK Connector
severity: high
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: 1.2.0 to 1.2.44
preconditions: certain configurations of Apache httpd using mod_jk as reverse proxy
poc_classification: auth-bypass

## Vulnerability
Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.44 allows specially constructed requests to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy. In some configurations a specially constructed request can bypass access controls configured in httpd. Unauthenticated attackers can gain unauthorized access to the JK Status Manager interface, potentially leading to Tomcat Manager access and further server compromise.  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5), CWE-22.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template sends GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/jkstatus` and `{{BaseURL}}/jkstatus;` then matches HTTP 200 responses containing the string "JK Status Manager" to confirm the protected endpoint is exposed without authentication.
