## Vulnerability
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in /scp/index.php in Enhancesoft osTicket before 1.10.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the "sort" parameter.

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, leading to potential data theft or unauthorized actions.

**CVSS:** 6.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
**CWE:** CWE-79

Remediation: Upgrade osTicket to 1.10.2 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET to `/scp/login.php` to confirm osTicket presence and extract the `__CSRFToken__` value. It then performs a POST to `/scp/login.php` using supplied `{{username}}` and `{{password}}` (plus the token) to establish an authenticated staff session. Finally it sends a GET to `/scp/index.php?sort="><script>alert(document.domain);</script>&dir=1` and matches on the exact unescaped payload string appearing in the response body (plus `text/html` content-type and HTTP 200).

This confirms reflected XSS in the authenticated staff control panel.
