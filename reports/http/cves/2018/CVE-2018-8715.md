## Vulnerability
Embedthis AppWeb versions before 7.0.3 and its underlying HTTP library contain a logic flaw in the authCondition function (`http/httpLib.c`). This allows attackers to bypass authentication for form and digest login types using forged HTTP requests.

**CVSS:** 8.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) | **CWE:** 287

**Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Remediation:** Apply the necessary patches or updates provided by the vendor to fix the authentication bypass vulnerability in AppWeb.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/ ` with the forged header `Authorization: Digest username=admin`. It verifies exploitation success via an AND matcher on HTTP status 200 and the presence of the Embedthis logo string `<a class="logo" href="https://embedthis.com/">&nbsp;</a>` in the response body, confirming authenticated content is accessible without valid credentials.
