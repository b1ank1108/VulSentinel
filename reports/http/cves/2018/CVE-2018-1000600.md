## Vulnerability
Jenkins GitHub Plugin 1.29.1 and earlier is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in `GitHubTokenCredentialsCreator.java`. The flaw permits an attacker-controlled `apiUrl` parameter to force the Jenkins server to issue arbitrary outbound HTTP requests. When combined with credentials IDs obtained via another vector, this enables capture of credentials stored in Jenkins.

Impact includes unauthorized access to internal resources, credential exfiltration, data leakage, and potential network pivoting. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 8.8); CWE-200.

Remediation: upgrade to version 1.29.2 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/securityRealm/user/admin/descriptorByName/org.jenkinsci.plugins.github.config.GitHubTokenCredentialsCreator/createTokenByPassword?apiUrl=http://{{interactsh-url}}`. Detection occurs by matching the `interactsh_protocol` word "http" to confirm an out-of-band HTTP callback was received, verifying the SSRF was triggered.
