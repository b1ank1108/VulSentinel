## Vulnerability

TITool PrintMonitor suffers from an unauthenticated time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability in the username parameter of the /login.php endpoint. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this to perform time-based blind SQLi and extract database contents, compromising user credentials and sensitive printing data. Remediation requires upgrading to PM18.2.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a crafted POST request to `/login.php` with a username value incorporating `')+OR+4191=LIKE('ABCDEFG',UPPER(HEX(RANDOMBLOB(50000000/2))))--+` to trigger a measurable delay on vulnerable systems. It matches when the response duration is >=6 seconds, status is 200, and the body contains "PrintMonitor" with appropriate HTML headers.
