## Vulnerability
WordPress WP Security Audit Log 3.1.1 plugin is susceptible to information disclosure. Access to `wp-content/uploads/wp-security-audit-log/*` files (including the `failed-logins/` subdirectory) is not restricted. An unauthenticated remote attacker can browse the directory index and retrieve sensitive audit log files containing failed login attempts and other security events.  
CVSS v3.0: 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) • CWE-532.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/uploads/wp-security-audit-log/failed-logins/` and matches on HTTP status 200 combined with directory-listing signatures ("[TXT]", ".log", "Index of") to confirm public exposure of the unprotected log directory and its files.
