## Vulnerability
WordPress JSmol2WP plugin versions 1.07 and earlier is affected by a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The flaw is in `php/jsmol.php` where the `data` parameter is not sanitized, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML. CVSS 3.0 score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Exploitation requires a victim to visit a crafted URL.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs an internal fingerprinting request to `/wp-content/plugins/jsmol2wp/readme.txt` to confirm 'JSmol2WP' plugin presence. It then issues a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with an encoded XSS payload in the `data` parameter (`</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`). Detection succeeds if the unsanitized payload appears in the response body, Content-Type includes `text/html`, and status is 200.
