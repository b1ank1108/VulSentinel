## Vulnerability
IPConfigure Orchid Core VMS 2.0.5 is susceptible to local file inclusion via directory traversal (CWE-22). An unauthenticated remote attacker can read arbitrary files on the server filesystem (e.g., /etc/passwd) by supplying specially crafted paths with multiple encoded `../` sequences.  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5).  
Impact: unauthorized access to sensitive information, potentially leading to further system compromise.  
Remediation: update to the latest version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e/etc/passwd` and confirms exploitation success via HTTP 200 status combined with regex match `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body.
