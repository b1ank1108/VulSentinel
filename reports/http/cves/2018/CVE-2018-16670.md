## Vulnerability
CirCarLife before 4.3 is vulnerable to improper authentication (CWE-287) due to lack of access controls on PLC status endpoints. Unauthenticated remote attackers can obtain sensitive PLC status information, potentially enabling data modification or unauthorized operations on the SCADA system. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3). Impact includes disclosure of critical industrial control system details. Remediation requires upgrade to 4.3 or higher.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/services/user/values.xml?var=STATUS` and confirms exploitation by matching the string "CirCarLife Scada" in the response header plus the body containing both "<values><variable><id>" and "Reader.STATUS".
