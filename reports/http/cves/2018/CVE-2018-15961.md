## Vulnerability
Adobe ColdFusion contains an unrestricted file upload vulnerability (CWE-434) in the CKEditor file manager endpoint `/cf_scripts/scripts/ajax/ckeditor/plugins/filemanager/upload.cfm`. Unaffected versions allow remote attackers to upload and immediately execute arbitrary JSP files, resulting in full remote code execution and system compromise.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8 Critical). Successful exploitation grants arbitrary code execution.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the flaw by issuing a multipart/form-data POST upload of a benign JSP payload (that prints the static MD5 hash `ddbb3e76f92e78c445c8ecb392beb225` of the string "CVE-2018-15961") to the filemanager endpoint using a randomized filename, then immediately performs a GET to the uploaded path `/cf_scripts/scripts/ajax/ckeditor/plugins/filemanager/uploadedFiles/{{randstr}}.jsp`. It confirms exploitation via HTTP 200 and presence of the exact hash string in the response body.
