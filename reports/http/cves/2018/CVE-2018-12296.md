## Vulnerability

CVE-2018-12296 is an insufficient access control vulnerability in Seagate NAS OS version 4.3.15.1. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to obtain sensitive information about the NAS device through an API endpoint (`/api/external/7.0/system.System.get_infos`) that lacks proper authentication controls. By sending empty POST requests to this endpoint, attackers can retrieve system information including version details and serial numbers without any credentials. This information disclosure vulnerability is classified under CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) and has a CVSS v3.0 score of 7.5 (High severity) with an attack vector that is network-based, requires low complexity, no privileges, and no user interaction.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated POST request to the `/api/external/7.0/system.System.get_infos` API endpoint with no request body. The template verifies the vulnerability by checking for the presence of both `"version":` and `"serial_number":` strings in the JSON response body, confirming that sensitive system information is being disclosed without authentication. Additionally, the template extracts the version number from the response using a regex pattern to capture the specific NAS OS version running on the target system.
