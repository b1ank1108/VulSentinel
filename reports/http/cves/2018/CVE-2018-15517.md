## Vulnerability
D-Link Central WifiManager (CWM-100 1.03 r0098) is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the MailConnect feature. The `/index.php/System/MailConnect` endpoint, intended for checking SMTP server connections, allows arbitrary outbound TCP requests to any IP address and port via the `host` and `port` parameters. This can facilitate internal network scanning, firewall bypass, and access to otherwise unreachable services.

Impact: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to internal resources, data leakage, and potential compromise of the entire network.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php/System/MailConnect/host/{{interactsh-url}}/port/80/secure/` to trigger an outbound HTTP request from the vulnerable server to an attacker-controlled interactsh domain. It verifies the vulnerability by matching for an "http" protocol interaction in the out-of-band callback.
