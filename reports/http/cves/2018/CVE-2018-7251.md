## Vulnerability
Anchor CMS 0.12.3 exposes its error log at `/anchor/errors.log` (due to missing access controls in `config/error.php`). The publicly readable log file contains full JSON error entries—including MySQL connection strings, usernames, and passwords—whenever a database error such as “Too many connections” has previously occurred.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a single unauthenticated `GET {{BaseURL}}/anchor/errors.log` request and confirms exposure by matching the three mandatory JSON log fields (`"date":`, `"message":`, `"trace":[`) with an AND word matcher.
