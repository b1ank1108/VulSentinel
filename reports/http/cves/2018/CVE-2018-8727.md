## Vulnerability
Mirasys DVMS Workstation <=5.12.6 suffers from a local file inclusion vulnerability due to improper path handling. The flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to traverse the filesystem and read arbitrary files via specially crafted URLs. This can lead to exposure of sensitive system files, configuration data, or credentials.  
Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive information (C:H/I:N/A:N), CVSS 7.5. CWE-22.  
Remediation per template: Upgrade to >=5.12.7.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template sends a single GET request using extensive path traversal (`/.../` repeated nine times) to reach `/windows/win.ini` from the web root. It confirms exploitation by matching multiple strings in the response body: "bit app support", "fonts", and "extensions" (standard content from a Windows win.ini file). This verifies the LFI without requiring authentication.
