## Vulnerability

PrismaWEB is susceptible to credential disclosure. Hard-coded administrator credentials are exposed in the publicly accessible `/user/scripts/login_par.js` file. These credentials (referenced as `txtChkUser` and `txtChkPassword`) are used by the `Login()` function in `/scripts/functions_cookie.js`, allowing unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and gain administrator privileges (CWE-798, CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H 9.8).

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/user/scripts/login_par.js` and matches for the presence of both 'txtChkUser' and 'txtChkPassword' in the body (with HTTP 200 status) to identify the vulnerable configuration exposing hard-coded credentials.
