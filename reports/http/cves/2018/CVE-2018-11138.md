## Vulnerability
Quest KACE System Management Appliance 8.0.318 is affected by unauthenticated remote code execution (CWE-78) in `/common/download_agent_installer.php`. The script is reachable by anonymous users and permits arbitrary OS command execution through unsanitized input.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8).  
Impact includes full system compromise, data exfiltration, or lateral movement.  
Remediation requires upgrading beyond 8.0.318 or applying Quest patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` (with host-redirects enabled) and performs passive fingerprinting: it verifies the response body contains "kace" or "quest" (case-insensitive) and extracts the build version via regex `\?build=([0-9.]+)`. The DSL matcher `compare_versions(detected_version, "8.0.318")` combined with the product string confirms the vulnerable release. No exploitation payload is sent; detection is limited to version/product identification on the landing page.
