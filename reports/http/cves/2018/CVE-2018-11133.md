Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the `fmt` parameter of `/common/run_cross_report.php` (CVE-2018-11133, CWE-79) affecting Quest KACE SMA 8.0.318.  
Unauthenticated remote attackers can supply a malicious `fmt` value that is reflected unsanitized into the response body.  
A victim visiting the crafted URL executes arbitrary JavaScript in their browser context (changed origin).  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).  
Impact: session-cookie theft, credential capture, or actions performed as the victim user.  
Remediation: upgrade to vendor-patched version.
