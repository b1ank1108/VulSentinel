## Vulnerability
Schneider Electric U.motion Builder 1.3.4 suffers from a critical remote code execution (CVE-2018-7841, CWE-78, CVSS 9.8 AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) vulnerability caused by improper input sanitization. Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary system commands by injecting payloads (e.g., backtick command substitution) into the `object_id` parameter of the reporting module. The product is retired and no longer supported; complete removal is required.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single POST request to `/umotion/modules/reporting/track_import_export.php` with form-encoded payload `op=export&language=english&interval=1&object_id=`ping -c 1 {{interactsh-url}}`` and verifies success through a DNS interaction callback, HTTP 200 status, and `application/octet-stream` content-type.
