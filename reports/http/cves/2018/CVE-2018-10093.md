## Vulnerability
AudioCodes 420HD IP phone devices with firmware version 2.2.12.126 are affected by a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2018-10093, CWE-862). The flaw allows execution of arbitrary commands on the device.

Severity: high (CVSS:3.0 8.8 - AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Impact: Complete device compromise and potential unauthorized VoIP network access.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/command.cgi?cat%20/etc/passwd` and matches for HTTP 200 status along with the regex `admin:.*:*sh$` in the body to confirm command execution succeeded (proof of RCE via command injection in the command.cgi endpoint).
