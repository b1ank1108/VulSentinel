## Vulnerability

CVE-2018-16761 is an open redirect vulnerability affecting Eventum versions prior to 3.4.0. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site) and allows an attacker to craft malicious URLs that redirect users to arbitrary external websites. The flaw exists in the `select_project.php` and `clock_status.php` endpoints, which accept URL parameters without proper validation. This can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, steal credentials, or deliver malware by tricking users into clicking seemingly legitimate links that redirect to attacker-controlled domains. The vulnerability requires no authentication and has a CVSS v3.0 score of 6.1 (Medium), with the attack vector being network-based, low complexity, requiring no privileges but user interaction, and resulting in low confidentiality and integrity impact with changed scope.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: state-change

The template detects this vulnerability by sending GET requests to two known vulnerable endpoints:
1. `/select_project.php?url=http://interact.sh`
2. `/clock_status.php?current_page=http://interact.sh`

The detection uses a stop-at-first-match strategy, testing each endpoint sequentially. The template matches against the HTTP response headers using a regex pattern that identifies Location headers redirecting to the external domain `interact.sh`. The regex specifically looks for various redirect patterns including absolute URLs, protocol-relative URLs, and path-based redirects that lead to the external domain. A successful match indicates the application is vulnerable to open redirect attacks, as it accepts and processes arbitrary URLs in these parameters without proper validation or sanitization.
