[Agent 2][AgentThink] Extracted signals from template:
- name: Ncomputing vSPace Pro 10 and 11 - Directory Traversal → affected_product: Ncomputing vSpace Pro
- severity: high
- auth: no creds, direct GET to traversal paths → none
- no interactsh/OOB → external_callback: false
- versions 10 and 11 in description → affected_versions: versions 10 and 11
- no extra config/features mentioned → preconditions: []
Classification: info-leak (directory traversal / LFI to read arbitrary files like win.ini)
Template does path traversal probes to /windows/win.ini with dots and backslashes, matches win.ini strings.
[Agent 3][AgentThink] Extracted signals from the YAML:

- affected_product: Ncomputing vSpace Pro (from info.name and metadata, stripping traversal part)
- severity: high
- authentication: none (simple unauth GET requests to BaseURL with traversal)
- external_callback: false (no interactsh or OOB)
- affected_versions: 10 and 11 (explicitly from description and name)
- preconditions: [] (no additional configs or features mentioned)

Classification for PoC: info-leak (directory traversal / LFI allowing arbitrary file read)

Template does path traversal with various ../ and ..\ sequences targeting win.ini and matches specific strings in body.

Vulnerability section: Directory traversal in Ncomputing vSpace Pro 10/11 allowing file reads.
[Agent 2][AgentThink] Draft for report:



## Vulnerability

Ncomputing vSpace Pro versions 10 and 11 suffer from a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files from the server filesystem.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs detection by issuing GET requests with multiple directory traversal sequences (using `.../` and `....\` variants) to access `windows/win.ini` and checks the response body for characteristic strings from the file (`bit app support`, `fonts`, `extensions`).

[Agent 1][AgentThink] Extracted signals for CVE-2018-10201 template:
- Product: Ncomputing vSpace Pro (from name/desc/CPE)
- Severity: high
- Auth: none (pure unauth GET with path traversal, no creds)
- Callback: false (no interactsh)
- Versions: 10 and 11 (explicit in description)
- Preconditions: [] (no config/features mentioned)

Classification for PoC: info-leak (LFI/dir traversal for arbitrary file read)
Template action: multiple traversal payloads to fetch win.ini and match INI strings.

Ready for report. Need me to draft anything?

## Vulnerability
Ncomputing vSpace Pro versions 10 and 11 suffer from a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22). CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the target system filesystem.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs detection by issuing four GET requests with heavy directory traversal sequences (`/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../windows/win.ini`, backslash and mixed `..../` variants) targeting the Windows `win.ini` file, then matches the response body for the exact strings `bit app support`, `fonts`, and `extensions` (using AND condition and stop-at-first-match).
