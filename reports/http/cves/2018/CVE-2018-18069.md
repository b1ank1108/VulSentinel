## Vulnerability
WordPress sitepress-multilingual-cms plugin 3.6.3 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (CVE-2018-18069, CWE-79) in the `process_forms` handler. Any `locale_file_name_*` parameter (e.g. `locale_file_name_en`) accepts unsanitized input during an authenticated `theme-localization.php` flow that reaches `wp-admin/admin.php` with `icl_post_action=save_theme_localization`. The payload is stored server-side and later reflected, enabling script injection into pages viewed by other users. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1). Impact includes malicious script execution leading to data theft or unauthorized actions. Remediation requires updating to the latest version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues a single POST to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin/admin.php` carrying `icl_post_action=save_theme_localization&locale_file_name_en=EN"><script>alert(0);</script>`. Success is confirmed when the response satisfies three conditions simultaneously: Content-Type contains `text/html`, the `Set-Cookie` header includes `_icl_current_admin_language`, and the response body contains the literal injected string `"><script>alert(0);</script>"`. This verifies that the unsanitized value was accepted, stored, and reflected.
