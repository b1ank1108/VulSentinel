## Vulnerability

Dell EMC iDRAC7/iDRAC8 devices running firmware versions prior to 2.52.52.52 contain a CGI injection vulnerability (CWE-94) that allows remote code execution. A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit CGI variables to inject and execute arbitrary code on the affected device. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical) with an EPSS score of 0.9379 (99.851th percentile), indicating widespread exploitation in the wild. The attack vector is network-based, requires low complexity, no privileges, and no user interaction, making it highly exploitable.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to `/cgi-bin/login` with the `LD_DEBUG=files` parameter. This parameter is a CGI variable that, when processed by vulnerable iDRAC firmware, triggers the injection flaw. The template checks for the presence of the string "calling init: /lib/" in the response, which indicates that the LD_DEBUG environment variable was successfully processed and the system is displaying dynamic linker debugging information. This response pattern confirms the device is vulnerable to CGI injection, which can be leveraged for remote code execution.
