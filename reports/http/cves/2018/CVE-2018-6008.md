## Vulnerability

CVE-2018-6008 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in Joomla! Jtag Members Directory version 5.3.7. The vulnerability exists in the `download_file` parameter of the component's attachment functionality. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this flaw to traverse the directory structure and read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) with a CVSS v3.0 score of 7.5 (High severity). The attack vector is network-based, requires low complexity, no privileges, and no user interaction, making it readily exploitable.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the Joomla! installation targeting the `com_jtagmembersdirectory` component. It exploits the vulnerable `download_file` parameter by injecting a path traversal payload (`../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`) to attempt reading the system's `/etc/passwd` file. The detection is confirmed through two conditions: (1) the response contains a regex pattern matching typical Unix password file entries (`root:.*:0:0:`), and (2) the HTTP response status is 200, indicating successful file retrieval. This demonstrates the ability to read unauthorized files from the server filesystem.
