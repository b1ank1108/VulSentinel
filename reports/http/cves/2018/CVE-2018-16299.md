## Vulnerability

WordPress Localize My Post plugin version 1.0 contains a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the `ajax/include.php` file. The vulnerability exists due to improper validation of the `file` parameter, allowing attackers to traverse directories and read arbitrary files on the server. This is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory). The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 score of 7.5 (High severity) with an EPSS score of 0.89546 (99.541th percentile), indicating a high likelihood of exploitation in the wild. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this flaw to access sensitive files, potentially exposing configuration files, credentials, and other confidential information stored on the web server.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/wp-content/plugins/localize-my-post/ajax/include.php` with a malicious `file` parameter containing a directory traversal payload (`../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`). The detection confirms the vulnerability by:

1. Checking for the presence of Unix password file content using a regex pattern matching `root:.*:0:0:` (indicating successful file read)
2. Verifying the HTTP response status is 200 (OK)

Both conditions must be satisfied for positive detection. The template uses a harmless probe (reading `/etc/passwd`) to verify the exploitable LFI condition without causing system damage.
