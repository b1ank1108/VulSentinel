## Vulnerability
Intelbras NPLUG 1.0.0.14 is vulnerable to authentication bypass through cookie manipulation. An attacker can bypass authentication by simply setting a cookie named "admin:". 

This improper authentication (CWE-287) permits unauthenticated remote attackers to reach the protected configuration download endpoint and retrieve RouterCfm.cfg. The file exposes credentials, wireless settings (wl_), passwords (_passwd), network configuration, and other sensitive data. 

CVSS v3.0: 8.1 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Impact includes full credential theft and potential device compromise. Remediation: update the device firmware to the latest version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single raw GET request to `/cgi-bin/DownloadCfg/RouterCfm.cfg` supplying the bypass cookie `Cookie: admin:`. It verifies successful exploitation (i.e., the authentication bypass works) by confirming status_code==200, content_type contains 'config/conf', and body contains both 'wl_' and '_passwd' strings that appear only in the legitimate configuration file.
