## Vulnerability
Acrolinx Server prior to 5.2.5 suffers from a local file inclusion vulnerability (CWE-22) via insufficient path sanitization allowing directory traversal.  
Unauthenticated remote attacker can read arbitrary files on the server filesystem.  
Impact: Successful exploitation results in unauthorized access to sensitive files, potentially leading to further system compromise.  
Remediation: Upgrade to version 5.2.5 or later.  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5 High).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues one raw unauthenticated GET request with deep path traversal (`/..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\windows\win.ini`) and matches the response body for the exact combination of strings "bit app support", "fonts", "extensions" (AND condition) to confirm successful file disclosure.
