## Vulnerability
Blueimp jQuery-File-Upload v9.22.0 contains an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload caused by insufficient validation in the upload component, letting remote attackers upload malicious files (exploit requires no authentication).  
Attackers can upload malicious files, potentially leading to remote code execution or server compromise.  
Remediation: Update to the latest version of Blueimp jQuery-File-Upload.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8) • CWE-434

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs an active verification by issuing a multipart/form-data POST request that uploads a randomly-named `.php` file containing `<?php echo md5("CVE-2018-9206"); ?>` to one of six common PHP upload-handler paths (e.g. `/jQuery-File-Upload/server/php/index.php`, `/server/php/UploadHandler.php`). It then issues two GET requests (to `/files/{{filename}}.php` and root `/files/{{filename}}.php`) and confirms successful RCE by checking that the response body contains the expected MD5 hash and returns HTTP 200. `stop-at-first-match` is enabled; the check is marked intrusive.
