## Vulnerability

CVE-2018-3714 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in node-srv, a Node.js application. The vulnerability stems from insufficient URL validation, allowing attackers to traverse the file system and read arbitrary files with known paths. The flaw is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.5 (Medium severity). The vulnerability enables unauthorized reading of sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data that could lead to further compromise.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by attempting to exploit the path traversal weakness to read the `/etc/passwd` file. It sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/node_modules/../../../../../etc/passwd`, using directory traversal sequences (`../`) to navigate outside the intended web root directory. The template confirms successful exploitation by:

1. Checking for a 200 HTTP status code
2. Verifying the response body contains the pattern `root:.*:0:0:`, which is characteristic of Unix/Linux passwd file entries

This detection method demonstrates the ability to read system files outside the application's intended directory structure, confirming the presence of the LFI vulnerability.
