## Vulnerability
Oracle Secure Global Desktop Administration Console 4.4 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in `helpwindow.jsp` via all parameters. The vulnerability allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript code through unsanitized query parameters (demonstrated with `windowTitle`), which is reflected back into the HTML response. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary script execution in the victim's browser context, potentially leading to session hijacking or unauthorized actions. Fixed in later versions including 5.4.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/sgdadmin/faces/com_sun_web_ui/help/helpwindow.jsp` with a specially crafted `windowTitle` parameter containing HTML tag closure and `<script>alert(1337)</script>` payload. It detects the vulnerability by matching the unsanitized payload string in the response body.
