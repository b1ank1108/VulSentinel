## Vulnerability
CirCarLife before 4.3 suffers from improper authentication (CWE-287). The `/html/repository` endpoint is exposed without any authentication, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to obtain internal installation path disclosure including platform sources and application sources. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification, and/or execution of unauthorized operations. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3). CPE: cpe:2.3:a:circontrol:circarlife_scada:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/html/repository` and matches on the presence of `CirCarLife Scada` in the response header together with both `** Platform sources **` and `** Application sources **` strings in the body.
