## Vulnerability

CVE-2018-14474 is an open redirect vulnerability in Orange Forum version 1.4.0. The vulnerability exists in the `views/auth.go` file and is triggered through the `next` parameter on the `/login` and `/signup` endpoints. An attacker can craft malicious URLs that redirect users to arbitrary external websites after authentication actions. This can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, steal credentials, or redirect users to sites hosting malware. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site) with a CVSS v3.0 score of 6.1 (Medium severity), requiring user interaction but no authentication to exploit.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: state-change

The template detects this open redirect vulnerability by sending GET requests to two endpoints:
1. `/login?next=http://interact.sh/?app.scan/`
2. `/signup?next=http://interact.sh/?app.scan/`

The detection mechanism uses a stop-at-first-match strategy and checks the HTTP response headers for a `Location` header that redirects to the attacker-controlled domain (interact.sh in this case). The template employs a regex pattern to match various forms of redirects including absolute URLs, protocol-relative URLs, and path-based redirects that ultimately lead to the external domain. A successful match indicates the application blindly trusts the `next` parameter and redirects users to arbitrary URLs without proper validation, confirming the presence of the open redirect vulnerability.
