## Vulnerability
Imcat 4.4 is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability (CWE-200, CVSS 7.5) allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to retrieve detailed phpinfo() output. This exposes sensitive configuration data including PHP version, loaded extensions, paths, environment variables, and server settings via the publicly accessible endpoint `/imcat/root/tools/adbug/binfo.php?phpinfo1`.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the vulnerability by performing a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/imcat/root/tools/adbug/binfo.php?phpinfo1` and verifying a 200 OK response containing both "PHP Extension" and "PHP Version" strings characteristic of phpinfo() output. It also extracts the PHP version via regex from the body.
