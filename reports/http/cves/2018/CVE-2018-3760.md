## Vulnerability
Ruby On Rails suffers from local file inclusion caused by secondary decoding in Sprockets 3.7.1 and lower versions. An attacker can use %252e%252e/ sequences to bypass path restrictions in the asset pipeline, access the root directory, and read or execute any file on the target server.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). CWE-200, CWE-22.  
Impact: unauthorized access to sensitive files and information stored on the server.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the LFI by sending two raw GET requests to the `/assets/` endpoint with crafted paths targeting `/etc/passwd`:
- Direct: `/assets/file:%2f%2f/etc/passwd`
- Traversal: repeated double-encoded `../` (`%252e%252e/%252e%252e/...`) sequences to escape the load path.

Matchers confirm success via HTTP 200 status and regex match for `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body (Unix passwd signature). An internal extractor captures the load-path error string from the body for dynamic path adjustment.
