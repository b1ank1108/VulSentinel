## Vulnerability
Cybrotech CyBroHttpServer 1.0.3 is vulnerable to local file inclusion (LFI) via insufficient path sanitization in the URI, allowing directory traversal attacks (CWE-22). This enables unauthorized reading of arbitrary files on the server. CVSS:3.0 score 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). Successful exploitation can lead to sensitive information disclosure, with potential for further compromise including remote code execution.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends an unsafe raw GET request `GET \..\..\..\..\Windows\win.ini HTTP/1.1` to the root and checks the response body for multiple strings indicative of the Windows `win.ini` file ("bit app support", "fonts", "extensions" with AND condition) to confirm the LFI.
