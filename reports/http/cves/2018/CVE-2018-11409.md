## Vulnerability

CVE-2018-11409 is an information disclosure vulnerability affecting Splunk versions through 7.0.1. The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive server information, including license keys, by appending a specific path (`__raw/services/server/info/server-info?output_mode=json`) to queries. This endpoint exposes internal server configuration data without requiring authentication, enabling attackers to retrieve confidential information such as licensing details that should be restricted. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) with a CVSS v3.0 score of 5.3, indicating medium severity with network-based attack vector, low complexity, and no privileges or user interaction required.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending unauthenticated HTTP GET requests to two potential endpoint paths:
1. `/en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/server/info/server-info?output_mode=json`
2. `/__raw/services/server/info/server-info?output_mode=json`

The detection mechanism verifies successful exploitation by checking for:
- The presence of the string "licenseKeys" in the response body, indicating that sensitive license information has been disclosed
- An HTTP 200 status code, confirming the endpoint is accessible and returned data

Both conditions must be satisfied (matchers-condition: and) to confirm the vulnerability. The template performs a non-destructive read operation that reveals whether the server exposes internal configuration data without authorization.
