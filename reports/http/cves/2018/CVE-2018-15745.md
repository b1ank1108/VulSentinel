## Vulnerability
Argus Surveillance DVR 4.0.0.0 suffers from an unauthenticated local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of the `RESULTPAGE` parameter in `WEBACCOUNT.CGI`. Attackers can use `..%2F` path traversal sequences to disclose arbitrary files on the system.

Impact: Allows reading sensitive files like configuration or system files (e.g., Windows/system.ini) leading to potential information disclosure.  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5, High). CWE-22.  
Remediation: Upgrade to a patched version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/WEBACCOUNT.CGI` with a deeply nested path traversal payload targeting `Windows/system.ini` (`RESULTPAGE=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2FWindows%2Fsystem.ini`) along with fixed parameters `OkBtn=++Ok++`, `USEREDIRECT=1`, empty `WEBACCOUNTID` and `WEBACCOUNTPASSWORD`. It verifies success by matching both "for 16-bit app support" and "[drivers]" strings (characteristic of Windows system.ini) in the 200 OK response body.
