cve_id: CVE-2018-17207
template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2018/CVE-2018-17207.yaml
affected_product: WordPress Duplicator Plugin
severity: critical
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: < 1.2.42
preconditions: presence of leftover installer-backup.php (and installer.php) files after installation
poc_classification: rce
---

## Vulnerability
An issue was discovered in Snap Creek Duplicator (WordPress Duplicator Plugin) before 1.2.42. By accessing leftover installer files (installer.php and installer-backup.php), an unauthenticated attacker can inject PHP code into wp-config.php during the database setup step, achieving arbitrary code execution. This leads to complete WordPress site compromise and potential server takeover.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a POST request to `/installer-backup.php` with `action_step=1` to reach the installer interface. It extracts the version via regex from the body (`Plugin Version:.*?([0-9].*?)<`), confirms Duplicator installer presence with body words (`<title>Duplicator</title>`, `dupx-header-version`, `Deployment Path:`) and HTTP 200 status, then applies DSL matcher `compare_versions(version, '< 1.2.42')`. Full RCE payloads (database config injection and wp-config verification) are commented out to prevent site modification.
