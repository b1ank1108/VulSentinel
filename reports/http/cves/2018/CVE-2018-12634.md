## Vulnerability

CVE-2018-12634 is a system log exposure vulnerability in CirCarLife Scada versions prior to 4.3. CirCarLife is an internet-connected electric vehicle charging station (EVSE) management system. The vulnerability allows remote unauthenticated attackers to obtain sensitive information by directly requesting the `/html/log` or `/services/system/info.html` URIs. This information disclosure flaw is classified as CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and has a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating critical severity. The vulnerability requires no authentication, low attack complexity, and can potentially lead to unauthorized access or further system compromise through the exposed system logs.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated GET request to the `/html/log` endpoint on the target system. The template verifies the vulnerability through three conditions:

1. Checks for the presence of "CirCarLife Scada" in the HTTP response headers, confirming the target is running the vulnerable software
2. Validates that the response body contains system log indicators including "user.debug", "user.info", and "EVSE" (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) strings, confirming that sensitive log data is being exposed
3. Ensures the server returns a 200 OK status code, indicating successful unauthorized access to the log files

All three conditions must be met simultaneously for a positive detection, confirming that system logs are accessible without authentication.
