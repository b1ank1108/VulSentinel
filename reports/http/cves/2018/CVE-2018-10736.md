## Vulnerability
SQL injection (CWE-89) in Nagios XI <= 5.4.12 via the `key1` parameter of `/nagiosql/admin/info.php`. Authenticated administrators can execute arbitrary SQL to read, modify or delete database contents, enabling full instance compromise.  
CVSS v3.0: 7.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Remediation: upgrade to 5.4.13 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change  
The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/nagiosql/admin/info.php?key1=%27%20union%20select%20concat(md5({{num}}))%23` (where `num` is a random 10-digit integer). It matches the literal MD5 hash of `num` in the response body to confirm the injected SQL was executed and the result returned inline.
