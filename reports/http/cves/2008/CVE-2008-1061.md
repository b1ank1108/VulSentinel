## Vulnerability
WordPress Sniplets plugin <=1.2.2 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2008-1061, CWE-79). Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `text` parameter to `warning.php`, `notice.php`, and `inset.php` in `view/sniplets/` (and possibly `modules/execute.php`), the `url` parameter to `view/admin/submenu.php`, and the `page` parameter to `view/admin/pager.php`.

CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N (score 4.3). Successful exploitation enables data theft, session hijacking, or website defacement for users who view attacker-controlled links.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues an internal GET to `/wp-content/plugins/sniplets/readme.txt` and matches the word "Code Snippets" to fingerprint the installed plugin. It then sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/sniplets/view/sniplets/warning.php?text=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` (URL-encoded) and verifies the exact payload is reflected unsanitized in the response body, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
