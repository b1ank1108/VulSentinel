## Vulnerability
AppServ Open Project <=2.5.10 and earlier contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in index.php. Remote unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML through the unsanitized `appservlang` parameter.  
CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N (score 4.3) • CWE-79.  
Impact includes malicious script execution in victim browsers, enabling data theft, session hijacking, or website defacement.  
Remediation: upgrade to >=2.5.11 or apply vendor patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change  
The template sends a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?appservlang=%3Csvg%2Fonload=confirm%28%27xss%27%29%3E` and matches three conditions simultaneously: the exact payload string appears unsanitized in the response body, the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, and HTTP status is 200. This confirms the parameter reflection flaw that permits client-side script/HTML injection and page content modification in the victim's browser context.
