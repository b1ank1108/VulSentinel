## Vulnerability
CMSimple 3.1 is susceptible to local file inclusion via cmsimple/cms.php when register_globals is enabled which allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the sl parameter to index.php. NOTE: this can be leveraged for remote file execution by including adm.php and then invoking the upload action. NOTE: on 20080601, the vendor patched 3.1 without changing the version number.

- CVE: CVE-2008-2650 (CWE-22)
- CVSS: 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
- Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive files, remote code execution, and potential compromise of the entire system.
- Remediation: Upgrade CMSimple to a patched version or apply the necessary security patches provided by the vendor.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw GET request `GET /index.php?sl=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` (with Host header) and matches on HTTP 200 status plus regex `root:.*:0:0:` anywhere in the response body to confirm successful LFI of /etc/passwd.
