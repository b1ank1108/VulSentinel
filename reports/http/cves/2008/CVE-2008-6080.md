## Vulnerability
Joomla! ionFiles 4.4.2 (com_ionfiles component) contains a local file inclusion flaw in `download.php`. Remote attackers can read arbitrary server files by injecting `..` path traversal sequences into the `file` parameter.  
CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N (score 5.0). CWE-22. Successful exploitation exposes sensitive files (e.g. configuration, credentials) and can lead to further compromise including potential remote code execution.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends an unauthenticated GET request `{{BaseURL}}/components/com_ionfiles/download.php?file=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd&download=1` and verifies exploitation by confirming HTTP 200 status plus regex match for `root:.*:0:0:` (indicating /etc/passwd contents were returned).
