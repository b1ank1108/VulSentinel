## Vulnerability
Horde Groupware contains an administrative account with a blank password, which allows remote attackers to gain access. This enables unauthenticated access to sensitive administrative functions such as the user administration panel.  
Impact: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive administrative functions and potentially compromise the entire system.  
CVSS: 10.0 (CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)  
CWE: NVD-CWE-Other  
CPE: cpe:2.3:a:horde:horde:3.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*  
Remediation: Apply the latest security patches or upgrade to a patched version of Horde Groupware.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template sends unauthenticated GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/horde/admin/user.php` and `{{BaseURL}}/admin/user.php`. It verifies exploitation conditions by matching HTTP status 200 and the exact string `<title>Horde :: User Administration</title>` in the response body, confirming the admin user management interface is directly reachable without credentials.
