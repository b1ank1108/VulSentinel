## Vulnerability
An open redirect vulnerability exists in GPT Academic v1.3.9 where the `file` parameter on the `/file=` endpoint reflects attacker-controlled URLs directly into the `Location` header. Unauthenticated attackers can supply arbitrary redirect targets (e.g. `https://oast.pro`), enabling phishing campaigns that leverage the trusted domain to steal credentials or deliver malware.

**Impact**: Unauthenticated attackers can redirect users to malicious URLs via the `file` parameter, facilitating phishing attacks and credential theft.  
**Remed
