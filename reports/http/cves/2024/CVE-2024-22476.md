## Vulnerability
Improper input validation (CWE-20) in Intel Neural Compressor before version 2.5.0 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to escalate privileges.  
**Impact**: Unauthenticated attackers can escalate privileges or perform malicious actions.  
**CVSS v3.1**: 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**Remediation**: Update to version 2.5.0 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template issues a single unauthenticated POST request to `/task/submit/` containing a JSON body with `script_url` pointing to a Hugging Face Transformers example, `optimized: "False"`, evaluation arguments for `bert-base-cased` on MRPC, `approach: "static"`, and default workers/requirements. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 with `application/json` Content-Type and body containing both `"status":"successfully"` and `"Task submitted successfully"`.
