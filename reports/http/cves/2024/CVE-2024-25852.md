## Vulnerability
Linksys RE7000 v2.0.9, v2.0.11, and v2.0.15 have a command execution vulnerability in the "AccessControlList" parameter of the access control function point. An attacker can use the vulnerability to obtain device administrator rights.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a raw PUT request to `/goform/AccessControl` with JSON body `{"AccessPolicy":"0","AccessControlList":"`ps>/etc_ro/lighttpd/RE7000_www/{{rand_base(5)}}.txt`"}` to inject a backtick command that writes `ps` output to a file in the web root, then issues a GET request to retrieve that file and verifies success via DSL matchers confirming status_code 200 on both requests and presence of process-list fields (PID, USER, VSZ, STAT, COMMAND) in the body.
