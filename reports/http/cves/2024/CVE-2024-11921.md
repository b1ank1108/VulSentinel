## Vulnerability
Give WP Plugin for WordPress (< 3.19.0) contains a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The `give-clear-update` GET parameter on `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=give-forms` is neither sanitized nor escaped before being reflected in the page HTML output. Unauthenticated attackers can craft malicious URLs injecting arbitrary JavaScript. When a logged-in administrator visits the link, the payload executes in the victim's browser context (S:C), enabling theft of session cookies and credentials. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 7.1). Impact explicitly includes administrator session/credential theft.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first authenticates by POSTing `log={{username}}&pwd={{password}}` to `/wp-login.php`, then issues two sequential GET requests to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=give-forms` with `give-clear-update` set to test payloads `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and `1"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. Detection succeeds when the response satisfies all DSL matchers: status_code == 200, content_type contains "text/html", and body contains both the unsanitized `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` string and `give_forms_page_`.
