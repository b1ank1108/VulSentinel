## Vulnerability
CVE-2024-12760 is an open redirect vulnerability in BentoML v1.3.9. The `file` parameter of the `/ui/gradio_api/file=` Gradio API endpoint reflects the supplied value directly into the HTTP `Location` header with no validation or sanitization. Unauthenticated remote attackers can therefore craft a URL that forces any visitor to an attacker-chosen external domain, enabling phishing, credential-harvesting, or supply-chain redirection attacks. No server-side state is altered, no data is leaked from the application, and no authentication or special configuration is required beyond the presence of the BentoML UI endpoint.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues one unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/ui/gradio_api/file=https://oast.me` and applies a regex matcher on the `Location` response header. If the header value contains the attacker-controlled `oast.me` domain, the match fires and the finding is reported. This is a harmless behavioral probe that confirms the open-redirect condition exists; the template performs no data exfiltration, state change, or destructive action.
