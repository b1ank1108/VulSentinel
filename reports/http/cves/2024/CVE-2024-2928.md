## Vulnerability
MLflow versions prior to 2.11.3 are vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack (CVE-2024-2928) caused by improper URI fragment parsing in the artifact handling. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files on the server filesystem.

**Impact**: Arbitrary file disclosure (e.g., /etc/passwd), potentially exposing sensitive configuration, credentials, or system files.  
**CVSS 3.1**: 7.5 (High) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  
**CWE**: CWE-29 (Path Traversal)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the vulnerability through a multi-step process that exploits the path traversal in model artifact retrieval:  
1. Creates a new experiment with a malicious `artifact_location` containing path traversal sequences (`http:///#/../../../../../../etc/`).  
2. Creates a run under this experiment.  
3. Creates a registered model.  
4. Creates a model version with `source` set to `file:///etc/`.  
5. Requests the artifact at path `passwd` via `/model-versions/get-artifact`.  
6. Matches the response body for `/etc/passwd` content (root user entry) and download headers (`filename=passwd`, `application/octet-stream`).  

This confirms the LFI allows reading arbitrary files without authentication.
