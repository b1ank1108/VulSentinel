## Vulnerability
Path traversal (CWE-22, CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N, score 9.1) in Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance before 4.6 Patch 519 allows remote unauthenticated attackers to access restricted administrative functionality. Unauthenticated attackers can reach protected endpoints such as the user management interface, exposing sensitive features and potentially enabling full unauthorized control of the appliance.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/client/index.php%3F.php/gsb/users.php` (path-traversal payload via encoded query) and verifies success with HTTP 200 status plus simultaneous presence of the strings "Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance", "User name", and "Set Password" in the response body. This confirms the administrative users management page is reachable without authentication.
