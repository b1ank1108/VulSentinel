## Vulnerability
Hostel WordPress plugin before 1.1.5.3 fails to sanitise and escape a user-supplied parameter before reflecting it in the response on the admin bookings management page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wphostel_bookings&do=edit&id=&type=upcoming&offset=`), resulting in reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) that targets high-privilege users such as administrators.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L (score 5.9)  
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template first issues a GET / request and internally matches the plugin path string "/wp-content/plugins/hostel" in the body to confirm installation. It then performs a POST login to /wp-login.php (using supplied username/password credentials) followed by a GET request to the vulnerable admin endpoint injecting the payload `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` into both the `offset` and `type` parameters. The vulnerability is verified if the second response contains the exact unsanitized script tag in the body, returns status 200, and has text/html content-type.
