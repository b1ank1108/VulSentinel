## Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the NuPoint Unified Messaging (NPM) component of Mitel MiCollab through 9.8 SP1 FP2 (9.8.1.201) allows an unauthenticated attacker to conduct a path traversal attack due to insufficient input validation on the `/npm-pwg/` path (CWE-22). Successful exploitation enables unauthorized access to internal endpoints such as Axis2 web services, allowing the attacker to view, corrupt, or delete users' data and system configurations.

**Impact**: Unauthenticated attackers can exploit path traversal to access sensitive user data, system configurations, and corrupt or delete information.  
**Remediation**: Update Mitel MiCollab to a version later than 9.8 SP1 FP2 that patches CVE-2024-41713.  
**CVSS v3.1**: 7.5 High (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single raw request:  
`GET /npm-pwg/..;/axis2-AWC/services/listServices HTTP/1.1`  
It verifies the vulnerability if the response status is 200 and the body contains both "Available services" and "Service Description", confirming successful traversal to the restricted internal Axis2 services listing endpoint.
