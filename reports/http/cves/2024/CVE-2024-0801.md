## Vulnerability
A denial of service vulnerability exists in Arcserve Unified Data Protection 9.2 and 8.1 in ASNative.dll. Remote unauthenticated attackers can cause system crashes or unavailability by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to the EdgeServiceConsoleImpl endpoint, leading to service disruption and potential downtime.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (score 7.5).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: dos

The template uses `flow: http(1) && http(2)` to perform two sequential POST requests to `/management/services/EdgeServiceConsoleImpl`.  
- Request 1 (internal precondition check): valid-looking `validateUserByUser` SOAP envelope with random lowercase username/password; matches status_code == 500 + text/xml content-type + "Invalid user credentials" in body.  
- Request 2 (exploit probe): same envelope but with `\` inserted in the username argument (`<arg0>\</arg0>`); matches status_code == 503 containing "<h1>Service Unavailable</h1>" OR status_code == 502 containing "<h1>Proxy Error</h1>".
