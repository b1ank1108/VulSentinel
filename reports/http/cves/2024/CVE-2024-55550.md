## Vulnerability
Mitel MiCollab (CMG Suite) is affected by an arbitrary file read vulnerability. Unauthenticated attackers bypass access controls and exploit path traversal by sending specially crafted requests to npm-pwg endpoints, allowing retrieval of arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem including sensitive configuration files, credentials, and system data such as /etc/passwd.

**Impact:** Full exposure of server secrets and user data without any authentication.

**Remediation:** Update Mitel MiCollab according to MISA-2024-0029 advisory to address the authentication bypass and path traversal vulnerabilities.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template uses a two-request HTTP flow that exploits the flaw to confirm arbitrary file read.  
1. GET `/npm-pwg/..;/usp/searchUsers.do` (path traversal) with internal matcher checking for "users" and "Network Element".  
2. POST `/npm-pwg/..;/ReconcileWizard/reconcilewizard/sc/IDACall` containing a crafted XML transaction that sets `reportName` to `../../../etc/passwd` inside a `downloadReport` operation against the `summary_reports` dataSource; success is verified by regex matches for `root:.*:0:0:` or `micollab_api:.*:.*` in the response body.
