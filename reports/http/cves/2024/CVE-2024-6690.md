## Vulnerability
The WP Content Copy Protection & No Right Click WordPress plugin (vendor: wp-buy, framework: wordpress) contains an open-redirect vulnerability (CVE-2024-6690, CWE-601) via the `referrer` parameter in `no-js.php`. The plugin before version 15.3 fails to validate or sanitize this parameter, allowing an attacker-supplied URL to be placed directly into a `Location` header. CVSS 3.1 base score is 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Impact includes phishing campaigns or malware distribution by redirecting authenticated or unauthenticated users to malicious external sites. Remediation requires updating to version 15.3 or later. The flaw was verified in an unauthenticated context with a single HTTP request.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues one unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/wccp-pro/no-js.php?referrer=https://oast.pro`. Detection succeeds on a 302 status code combined with a regex match on the `Location` response header that reflects the injected `oast.pro` domain, confirming the parameter is echoed without sanitization. No version comparison DSL, authentication tokens, or server-side state changes are involved; the probe only verifies the redirect behavior described in the vulnerability.
