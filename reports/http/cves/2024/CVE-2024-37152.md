## Vulnerability

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. CVE-2024-37152 allows unauthorized access to the sensitive settings exposed by the `/api/v1/settings` endpoint without authentication. All sensitive settings are hidden except `passwordPattern`.

Impact: Unauthenticated attackers can access sensitive password patterns and application settings exposed by the `/api/v1/settings` endpoint.

Remediation: Update Argo CD to a version that patches CVE-2024-37152.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues an unauthenticated GET request to `/api/v1/settings` and confirms exposure if the response returns HTTP 200 with `application/json` content-type containing both `"passwordPattern":` and `"appLabelKey":` in the body.
