## Vulnerability
The LearnDash LMS plugin for WordPress (cpe:2.3:a:learndash:learndash:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*) exposes sensitive quiz data via the unauthenticated REST API endpoint `/wp-json/ldlms/v1/sfwd-quiz`. All versions up to and including 4.10.1 are affected; fixed in 4.10.2. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (5.3). Unauthenticated remote attackers can retrieve quiz materials, questions, and course content intended only for enrolled learners.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json/ldlms/v1/sfwd-quiz` and confirms exposure when the response satisfies all three conditions simultaneously: HTTP 200, Content-Type containing `application/json`, and response body containing the strings `"id":`, `"quiz_materials":`, and `quizzes`.
