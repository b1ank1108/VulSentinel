## Vulnerability

The LearnDash LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure via its REST API endpoint in all versions up to and including 4.10.2. Unauthenticated attackers can access quiz questions, answer options, and point values.

Impact: Compromises the integrity of course assessments by leaking assessment content to unauthenticated users.

Remediation: Update to version 4.10.3 or later.

CVSS Score: 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json/wp/v2/sfwd-question` and verifies exposure by checking for HTTP 200 status, `application/json` Content-Type header, and the presence of key fields (`"id"`, `"question_type"`, `"points_total"`) in the JSON response body. This confirms that the quiz questions endpoint is publicly accessible without authentication.
