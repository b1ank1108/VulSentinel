## Vulnerability
The Stripe Payment Plugin for WooCommerce for WordPress versions <= 3.7.9 contains an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability. The flaw stems from insufficient escaping and lack of prepared statements on the `id` parameter when handling requests to the `?wc-api=wt_stripe` endpoint (processing simulated Stripe `charge.succeeded` webhook payloads). Unauthenticated remote attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to sensitive data disclosure or modification of database information.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET request to `/` (with host redirects enabled) and uses an internal matcher to confirm plugin presence via the string "payment-gateway-stripe" in the 200 OK response body. It then sends a POST request to `/?wc-api=wt_stripe` (Content-Type: application/json) containing the payload `{"type":"charge.succeeded","data":{"object":{"id":"sqli_test' AND (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT SLEEP(6))a)#","metadata":{"order_id":"999999"}}}` with a 10-second timeout. The vulnerability is verified if the response duration >= 6 seconds and status_code == 200.
