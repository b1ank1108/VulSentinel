## Vulnerability
Dash Framework versions before 2.15.0 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the href attribute in anchor tags, allowing javascript:alert(document.domain) protocol payload injection.  

CVE-ID: CVE-2024-21485  
CWE-ID: CWE-79  
CVSS v3.1: 5.4 (Medium) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  
CPE: cpe:2.3:a:plotly:dash:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*  
EPSS: 0.00493 (0.65245 percentile)  

Impact: data theft from users who access the compromised view; access token stealing enabling attacker impersonation.  
Remediation: upgrade to version 2.15.0 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a GET / request and matches either "dash-core-components" or "_dash-component-suites" anywhere in the response body to fingerprint the Dash application. It then sends a POST /_dash-update-component request with Content-Type application/json containing exactly the payload `{"output":"link-output.children","inputs":[{"id":"link-input","property":"value","value":"javascript:alert(document.domain)"}]}`. Detection succeeds when the server returns HTTP 200, Content-Type application/json, and the response body simultaneously contains the strings "props", "children", "type", and the verbatim unsanitized payload "javascript:alert(document.domain)". This confirms the component-update endpoint reflects raw user-controlled input, which becomes executable XSS when the frontend renders it inside an anchor-tag href attribute.
