## Vulnerability
LearnPress is a popular WordPress LMS plugin. Versions prior to 4.2.7.4 suffer from an information disclosure vulnerability in the REST API endpoint for course materials (class-lp-rest-material-controller.php). Unauthenticated attackers can access and extract paid course materials.

CVSS: 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  
CWE: CWE-284

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json/lp/v1/material/item-materials/1`. It verifies exposure by checking for a 200 OK response with application/json content-type containing "status", "success", and "message" fields (negative matcher for 'rest_no_route' errors). It also extracts the `file_name` of the material using a regex extractor from the JSON body.
