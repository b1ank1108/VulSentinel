## Vulnerability
Travelpayouts WordPress plugin <= 1.1.16 is vulnerable to open redirect. The flaw occurs due to insufficient validation on the `travelpayouts_redirect` variable. Unauthenticated attackers can redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action. Impact includes phishing attacks, credential harvesting, or malware distribution. Remediation: upgrade to the latest version of the plugin.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/?travelpayouts_redirect=https://oast.me`, follows up to 2 redirects, and uses a regex matcher on the `Location` response header to confirm reflection of the attacker-controlled domain. This harmless probe verifies the lack of redirect validation without executing any malicious payload.
