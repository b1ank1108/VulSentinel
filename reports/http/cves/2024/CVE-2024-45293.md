cve_id: CVE-2024-45293
template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2024/CVE-2024-45293.yaml
affected_product: TablePress
severity: high
authentication: required
external_callback: false
affected_versions: < 2.4.3
preconditions: authenticated access to TablePress XLSX import feature in WordPress admin
poc_classification: info-leak
---

## Vulnerability
TablePress WordPress plugin versions prior to 2.4.3 use a vulnerable version of the PHPSpreadsheet library. The XXE prevention scanner in the XLSX reader can be bypassed by modifying the XML structure with whitespace characters. This allows attackers to disclose server files and sensitive information through specially crafted XLSX spreadsheet uploads.

Impact: arbitrary server file disclosure.  
Remediation: upgrade to TablePress 2.4.3 or later.  
CVSS: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) | CWE-611.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the vulnerability by simulating an authenticated attack: logs into WordPress admin via `/wp-login.php`, extracts security nonces (`closedpostboxesnonce`, `meta-box-order-nonce`, `_wpnonce`) from the TablePress import page, POSTs a multipart form containing a hex-decoded malicious XLSX payload (bypassing XXE scanner) to `admin-post.php` with `tablepress_import` action (creating a new table), then GETs the new table's edit page and matches for the string "Hello World abc" confirming successful XXE processing and content disclosure.
