## Vulnerability
The WP Hotel Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'room_type' parameter of the /wphb/v1/rooms/search-rooms REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data leakage or database compromise.

Update to the latest version of WP Hotel Booking plugin that addresses this vulnerability, or apply security patches provided by the vendor.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template uses a two-request flow to confirm time-based blind SQL injection. The first benign GET request (`room_type=1` with valid search parameters) verifies the endpoint returns status 200 (internal matcher). The second request injects the payload `room_type=1") OR SLEEP(0.03)-- -`, applies a 15s timeout, and matches when response duration is >= 6s, status is 200, and body contains `{"status":"`.
