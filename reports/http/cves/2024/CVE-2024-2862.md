## Vulnerability
LG LED Assistant contains an unauthenticated password reset vulnerability in the `/api/changePw` endpoint. The application trusts the client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` header to determine localhost origin. An attacker can spoof `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` to bypass this check and trigger a password reset.

Attackers can reset passwords of anonymous users, potentially leading to unauthorized access and account takeover.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template sends a single raw PUT request to `/api/changePw` with spoofed `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`, `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, and form payload `newPw=Password@123&hostName={{hostname}}&to=to&user={{username}}&from=from`. It matches on HTTP 200 status and body containing `{"resCode":"SUCCESS"}`, confirming the password change succeeded.
