## Vulnerability
WebIQ 2.15.9 (Windows version) is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability. Unauthenticated remote attackers can read any file on the Windows system via specially crafted requests, potentially exposing sensitive configuration files, credentials, database files, and system information.

CVSS v3.0: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw GET request with repeated `..%5c` backslash-encoded traversal sequences from `/.webui/` to reach `windows\win.ini`. Detection succeeds if status_code is 200, Content-Type contains "image/svg+xml", and body contains win.ini markers ("bit app support", "fonts]", "extensions]").
