## Vulnerability
Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress versions up to 5.3.14 contains a stored cross-site scripting caused by insufficient sanitization and escaping of 'mapTypes' parameter in the 'wpw_auto_poster_map_wordpress_post_type' AJAX function. This lets unauthenticated attackers inject arbitrary scripts that execute when users access affected pages.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 7.2)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The nuclei template verifies the presence of WordPress and the plugin by requesting the homepage. It then injects a proof-of-concept XSS payload (`xss_test:<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`) via an unauthenticated POST to the admin-ajax.php endpoint. Success is confirmed by the response status. An alternative authenticated flow logs in and checks the settings page (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpw-auto-poster-settings) for the reflected payload in the body to confirm storage.
