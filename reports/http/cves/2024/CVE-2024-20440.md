## Vulnerability
Cisco Smart Licensing Utility suffers from an unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2024-20440, CWE-532). Excessive verbosity in a debug log file allows remote attackers to retrieve sensitive log files containing plaintext credentials (usable for API access) by sending a crafted HTTP GET request. Impact: unauthenticated attackers obtain debug logs with sensitive data. Remediation: update to a fixed version that prevents log file exposure. CVSS 3.1 score 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/cslu/v1/var/logs/customer-cslu-lib-log.log` and verifies exposure by matching HTTP status 200, Content-Type containing "text/x-log", and the string "csluev.log" anywhere in the response body.
