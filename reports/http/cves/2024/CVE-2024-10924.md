## Vulnerability
Really Simple Security (Free, Pro, and Pro Multisite) WordPress plugin is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions 9.0.0 to 9.1.1.1 due to improper user check error handling in the two-factor REST API `check_login_and_get_user` function. Unauthenticated attackers can log in as any user (including administrators) when Two-Factor Authentication is enabled.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8 Critical). Fixed in 9.1.2.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass
The template executes a 3-request flow:
1. GET /wp-login.php to extract login nonce via regex.
2. POST to `/?rest_route=/reallysimplessl/v1/two_fa/skip_onboarding` with user_id=1, nonce, and redirect_to to trigger bypass.
3. GET /wp-admin/profile.php and match for "Personal Options" in body + text/html content-type to confirm successful impersonation/login.
