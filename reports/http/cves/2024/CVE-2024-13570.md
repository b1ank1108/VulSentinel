## Vulnerability
Stray Random Quotes WordPress plugin <= 1.9.9 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization and escaping of the `qo` parameter on the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=stray_manage` page. Attackers can craft malicious URLs to execute JavaScript in the context of high-privilege users (e.g., admins), potentially leading to session hijacking, account compromise, or data theft.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template first performs authentication by POSTing credentials to /wp-login.php and verifying the wordpress_logged_in cookie. It then sends a GET request to the admin endpoint with an XSS payload injected into the qo parameter. Confirmation occurs by matching the unsanitized payload string in the HTML body response.
