## Vulnerability
Plenti static site generator versions prior to 0.7.2 contains an arbitrary file write vulnerability in the `/postLocal` endpoint. When the Plenti website is actively served, unauthenticated attackers can write arbitrary files to the server filesystem, which may lead to remote code execution (CWE-78). CVSS 3.1 score: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Fixed in v0.7.2.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the vulnerability by:
- Sending a POST request to `/postlocal` (JSON payload: `[{"Action": "create","Contents":"{{randstr}}","File": "static/{{filename}}.txt"}]` using a random filename) to perform an arbitrary file write.
- Issuing a follow-up GET to `/{{filename}}.txt` (with 5-second wait) and checking that the response body contains the injected random string, the `Content-Type` header is `text/plain`, and status is 200.

This confirms the file-write flaw that enables RCE escalation.
