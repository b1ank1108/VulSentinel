## Vulnerability
WordPress Stacks Mobile App Builder plugin ≤5.2.3 suffers from an authentication bypass via improper handling of query parameters (`mobile_co` and `uid`), allowing unauthenticated attackers to impersonate arbitrary users (e.g., uid=1 for administrator).  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-288, CWE-306. Account takeover leads to full system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

Template first fingerprints the plugin (internal GET to `/wp-content/plugins/stacks-mobile-app-builder/readme.txt`, requires status 200 + "Stacks Mobile App Builder" string). It then issues `GET /?mobile_co=1&uid=1` to trigger the bypass, followed by `POST /wp-admin/index.php` (with redirects). Detection succeeds if the final response is status 200 and contains all of "Dashboard", "Plugins", "Edit Profile", confirming the session is authenticated as the impersonated user.
