## Vulnerability
An Authentication Bypass vulnerability exists in Flowise version 1.8.2. This could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to access API endpoints as an administrator and allow them to access restricted functionality.  
Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication to access administrative API endpoints, gaining unauthorized access to restricted functionality, API keys, and administrative operations.  
Remediation: Update Flowise to a version later than 1.8.2.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template sends a single raw GET request to `/api/v1/apikey?/api/v1/ping` (with Accept and Referer headers, no credentials) and matches on HTTP 200 status, `application/json` Content-Type, and the presence of both `"apiKey"` and `"apiSecret"` strings in the JSON response body. It also extracts the `apiKey` value via regex when the condition is met.
