## Vulnerability
Unauthenticated OS command injection (CWE-78) via improper input validation in the login endpoint of Kemp/Progress LoadMaster load balancer.  
CVSS 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Unauthenticated remote attackers can inject arbitrary OS commands, resulting in full system compromise and potential lateral movement to backend infrastructure.  
Vulnerable products: LoadMaster ≥7.2.40.0, all ECS versions, Multi-Tenancy ≥7.1.35.4.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  

The template first issues a GET request to `/progs/homepage` and extracts the two hidden `token` and `token2` values via regex. It then sends a POST to `/progs/status/login` with a form payload containing a specially crafted `pass` field that embeds an encoded command injection (`;ping -c 2 <interactsh-domain>;echo '`). Detection succeeds when both a DNS interaction is observed on the interactsh domain **and** the response body contains the strings `alert("Login Failed");` and `2 packets transmitted`.
