## Vulnerability
UsersWP – Front-end login form, User Registration, User Profile & Members Directory plugin for WordPress contains a time-based SQL injection caused by insufficient escaping of the 'uwp_sort_by' parameter in all versions up to 1.2.10. Unauthenticated attackers who can control the 'uwp_sort_by' parameter can execute arbitrary SQL queries.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a clusterbomb attack sending GET requests to six candidate plugin directory paths (/users/, /members/, /user-list/, /member-directory/, /directory/, /all-users/) appending the payload `uwp_sort_by=display_name,(SELECT+SLEEP(6))_asc`. It verifies exploitation by matching on response duration >= 6 seconds, HTTP status code 200, and body containing any of "uwp-users", "uwp_page", or "wp-content/plugins/userswp". The probe is harmless and only confirms the injection point.
