severity: medium

## Vulnerability
ECT Home Page Products WordPress plugin through 1.9 contains a reflected XSS due to lack of sanitization/escaping of the `_id` parameter on the `ect_homepage_prod_add` admin page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ect_homepage_prod_add`). An attacker supplies a malicious link; when visited by a logged-in high-privilege user the injected JavaScript executes in the victim's browser context. Impact includes session hijacking and account compromise.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change  
The template first posts credentials to `/wp-login.php`, confirms login via presence of `wordpress_logged_in` cookie in headers (internal matcher). It then issues a GET to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ect_homepage_prod_add&_id=testxss"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script><script>` and matches HTTP 200 + unsanitized payload plus "ect-homepage-products" string in body (condition: and). This verifies reflection without escaping, enabling JS execution that can modify configuration or accounts in the victim's authenticated session.
