severity: medium
authentication: none

affected_versions: <=1.9.15.2
preconditions: WPS Hide Login plugin installed and active on WordPress site
poc_classification: info-leak

## Vulnerability
The WPS Hide Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Login Page Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.15.2. This is due to a bypass created when the 'action=postpass' parameter is supplied. Attackers can discover any login page that may have been hidden by the plugin.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template confirms a WordPress site with a GET request to the base URL (matching wp-content or wp-includes in body). It then issues two POST requests using the `action=postpass` parameter (one to /wp-login.php and one to /wp-admin/) with form data to bypass the hiding protection. Detection matches on HTTP 200 responses containing "lostpasswordform" and "action=" (without "wp-login.php"), or 302 redirects containing reauth or /login indicators. A regex extractor captures the hidden login URL from the form action attribute when present.
