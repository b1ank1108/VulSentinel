## Vulnerability
Dyn Business Panel WordPress plugin <= 1.0.0 suffers from reflected cross-site scripting due to missing sanitization/escaping of the `edit` parameter on the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=dbp_clients` endpoint. An unauthenticated attacker can supply a malicious link containing a breakout payload; when clicked by any authenticated high-privilege user the JavaScript executes in the victim's browser session. This enables session hijacking, data exfiltration from admin pages, or further client-side attacks.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L (score 7.1) • CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a POST to `/wp-login.php` with `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials and internally validates the presence of a `wordpress_logged_in` cookie. It then sends a GET request to the vulnerable admin page with the `edit` value set to the unsanitized XSS breakout string `$dbp_client_id"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script><script>&Submit=testxss"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script><script>`. Detection succeeds when the raw payload fragment appears verbatim in the HTML body, the string "Clientes" is present (confirming the plugin page rendered), the Content-Type is `text/html`, and the status is 200.
