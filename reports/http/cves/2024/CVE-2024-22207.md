## Vulnerability
fastify-swagger-ui is a Fastify plugin for serving Swagger UI. Prior to 2.1.0, the default configuration of `@fastify/swagger-ui` without `baseDir` set leads to all files in the module's directory being exposed via HTTP routes served by the module. The vulnerability is fixed in v2.1.0. Setting the `baseDir` option can also work around this vulnerability.

**Impact**: Unauthenticated attackers can access sensitive files in the Fastify Swagger-UI module directory, potentially exposing source code or configuration files.  
**CVSS 3.1**: 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)  
**CWE**: CWE-1188

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/documentation/playwright.config.js` and matches for HTTP status 200 combined with the presence of both "module.exports" and "defineConfig" strings.
