## Vulnerability

Changedetection.io is free, open-source web page change detection software. Versions <= 0.47.4 contain a path traversal (CWE-22) flaw in the file-fetching logic. When the `html_webdriver` backend is active, the filter blocking `file://` URLs can be bypassed with the `source:file:///` syntax (e.g., `source:file:///etc/passwd`), allowing arbitrary local file reads. Fixed in 0.47.5.

**Impact:** Attackers with access to the UI can retrieve sensitive system files (e.g., /etc/passwd), compromising host security.

**Remediation:** Upgrade to 0.47.5 or later.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template actively exploits the LFI to confirm vulnerability:

1. GET /settings → extract CSRF token.
2. POST /settings → force `application-fetch_backend=html_webdriver`.
3. GET / → extract second CSRF token.
4. POST /form/add/quickwatch → create watch with `url=source:file:///etc/passwd`.
5. GET / (with 9 s wait) → extract watch UUID from page body.
6. GET /preview/{{uuid}} → verify `root:x:0` and HTML content-type in response.

Successful match proves the backend processed the malicious `source:file://` path and returned local file contents.
