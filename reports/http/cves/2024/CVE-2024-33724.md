## Vulnerability
SOPlanning 1.52.00 is affected by a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2024-33724) via the `groupe_id` parameter when processing requests to `/process/groupe_save.php`. A remote attacker who can authenticate may inject arbitrary JavaScript, leading to session hijacking, credential theft, and full platform takeover.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first performs authentication using hardcoded default credentials (username: admin, password: admin) via POST to `/process/login.php`. It then sends a GET request to `/process/groupe_save.php?saved=1&groupe_id=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E%3C!--&nom=Project+New` containing the reflected XSS payload. Detection succeeds if the second response has status 200 and the body contains both the injected `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` tag and the string "SOPlanning".
