## Vulnerability
WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) WordPress plugin versions <= 9.0.29 are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting via the `map_id` parameter on the admin map edit page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-google-maps-menu&action=edit`).  

CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) • CWE-79.  

Impact includes arbitrary JavaScript execution in an authenticated administrator's browser, enabling session hijacking, privilege escalation, full WordPress admin account takeover, malicious plugin installation, and website defacement.  

Remediation: update to version 9.0.30 or later. Vendor: codecabin. Framework: WordPress.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first retrieves `/wp-content/plugins/wp-google-maps/readme.txt`, extracts the Stable tag version, and internally confirms it is <= 9.0.29 while verifying the plugin banner. It then posts credentials to `/wp-login.php` and internally validates the resulting 302 redirect plus `wordpress_logged_in` cookie. Finally it issues a GET to the map edit page injecting the payload `1'></a><script>alert(document.domain)</script><a x='` into `map_id` and matches on HTTP 200 + HTML content-type + literal reflection of the unsanitized `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` string alongside the plugin identifier.
