preconditions: Ninja Forms plugin installed on WordPress; requires high-privilege (admin) user to visit crafted URL
poc_classification: info-leak

## Vulnerability
Ninja Forms WordPress plugin versions 3.8.6-3.8.10 fail to escape a URL before outputting it in an HTML attribute on the submissions page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nf-submissions`). This produces a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw (CWE-79) exploitable against high-privilege users such as administrators. CVSS 3.1 score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Impact includes JavaScript execution in the victim's authenticated browser context, enabling session hijacking or unauthorized access to sensitive information. Fixed in 3.8.11.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET to `/` and confirms the Ninja Forms plugin is present by matching `/wp-content/plugins/ninja-forms` in the body. It then posts credentials to `/wp-login.php` to authenticate, followed by a GET to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nf-submissions&"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>=2`. Success is verified if the exact payload string appears unescaped in the second response body, the content-type is `text/html`, and the status is 200.
