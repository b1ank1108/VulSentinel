## Vulnerability
Palo Alto Expedition suffers from an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the Checkpoint configuration parser at `/bin/configurations/parsers/Checkpoint/CHECKPOINT.php`. 

Unauthenticated attackers can exploit the `signatureid` parameter to reveal sensitive database contents (password hashes, usernames, device configurations, device API keys) and to create or read arbitrary files on the underlying system.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template uses a two-step flow. First, it sends a benign POST request (`action=get&type=existing_ruleBases&project=pandbRBAC`) and verifies a 200 response containing "ruleBasesNames". Second, it issues a time-based blind SQLi payload using `SLEEP(6)` in the `signatureid` field of a similar POST request (`action=import&type=test...`) and matches on response duration >= 6 seconds with status 200.
