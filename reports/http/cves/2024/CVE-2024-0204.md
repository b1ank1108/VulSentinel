## Vulnerability
Fortra GoAnywhere MFT contains an authentication bypass (CVE-2024-0204, CWE-425) prior to version 7.4.1. An unauthenticated attacker can access the InitialAccountSetup wizard page via path traversal and create an administrator account.

Impact: Complete system takeover, including access to all managed file transfers and sensitive data.

CVSS: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/goanywhere/images/..;/wizard/InitialAccountSetup.xhtml` and verifies a 200 status code along with the presence of the strings "Create an administrator account" and "goanywhere" in the response body. This confirms the setup page is exposed without authentication.
