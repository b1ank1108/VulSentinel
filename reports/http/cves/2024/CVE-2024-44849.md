## Vulnerability
Qualitor <= 8.24 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Arbitrary File Upload in checkAcesso.php. Unauthenticated attackers can upload malicious PHP files to achieve remote code execution on the Qualitor server. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8), CWE-434.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs a two-step in-band verification: (1) POSTs a multipart/form-data request to `/html/ad/adfilestorage/request/checkAcesso.php` uploading a test PHP file `{{rand_base(12)}}.php` containing `<?php echo md5({{rand_int(1000,9999)}}); ?>` (with form fields idtipo=2, nmdiretoriorede=., empty bucket/key fields), matching on status 200 and alert strings "parent.showQAlert('Upload" and "showQAlert"; (2) follows up with GET to the uploaded file path and confirms RCE by matching the computed MD5 hash in the response body, text/html content-type, and status 200.
