## Vulnerability
The WPS Hide Login WordPress plugin before 1.9.16.4 fails to prevent redirects to the login page via WordPress's auth_redirect function. This allows unauthenticated visitors to discover and access the hidden login page, bypassing the plugin's security-by-obscurity protection against login page enumeration and brute-force attacks.

Impact: Unauthenticated attackers can locate the custom/hidden WordPress login URL.

Remediation: Update the plugin to version 1.9.16.4 or newer.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs detection in two HTTP requests. It first internally verifies plugin installation by fetching `/wp-content/plugins/wps-hide-login/readme.txt` and matching for "WPS Hide Login" string with HTTP 200. It then issues `GET /?gf_page=<random_alpha>` (exploiting Gravity Forms redirect behavior) and matches on a redirect where the Location header contains the encoded `%2F%3Fgf_page%3D<random>&reauth=1` parameter but does not contain "wp-login.php". The location value is extracted.
