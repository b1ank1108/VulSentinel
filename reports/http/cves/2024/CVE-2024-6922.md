## Vulnerability
Automation Anywhere Automation 360 v21-v32 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in a web API component. An unauthenticated attacker with access to the Control Room HTTPS service (port 443) or HTTP service (port 80) can supply a malicious `saasUrl` to trigger arbitrary outbound web requests from the server. Impact includes internal network reconnaissance, access to cloud metadata services, or chaining into further attacks. Remediation requires applying the latest vendor security patches and updates.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw POST request to `/v1/proxy/test` with JSON payload `{"saasUrl":"{{interactsh-url}}/?param=one#"}` and validates exploitation via an out-of-band DNS interaction on interactsh plus server response checks (HTTP 400 status, body containing `{"message":`, and `application/json` content-type).
