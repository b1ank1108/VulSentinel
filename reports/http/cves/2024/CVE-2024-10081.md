## Vulnerability
Authentication bypass in CodeChecker <= 6.24.1 occurs when any API URL ends with `Authentication`, `Configuration` or `ServerInfo`. The bypass grants unauthenticated superuser access to every other API endpoint (including product add/edit/remove operations and full configuration control).  
Impact: unauthenticated remote attackers obtain superuser privileges across the entire API surface (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N, score 10.0, CWE-288).  
Remediation: upgrade to 6.24.2 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template sends one raw POST request to `/v6.58/Products/Authentication` carrying the Thrift payload `[1,"getProducts",1,1,{}]` and verifies success if the response body contains `{"0":{"lst":["rec",`, the body does **not** contain `Error code 401: Unauthorized`, and the `Content-Type` header is `application/x-thrift`.
