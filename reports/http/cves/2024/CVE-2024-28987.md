## Vulnerability
SolarWinds Web Help Desk contains hardcoded credentials for the `helpdeskIntegrationUser` account (password: `dev-C4F8025E7`). This enables remote unauthenticated attackers to access internal functionality via Basic Authentication and modify data.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N (score 9.1). CWE-798.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a GET request to `/helpdesk/WebObjects/Helpdesk.woa/ra/OrionTickets/` including an Authorization header with the base64-encoded hardcoded credentials. Detection succeeds on status code 200 and presence of `displayClient` and `shortDetail` in the response body.
