## Vulnerability
Reposilite is an open-source lightweight repository manager for Maven artifacts in the JVM ecosystem. Versions >= 3.3.0 and < 3.5.12 are vulnerable to path traversal (CWE-22) while serving expanded javadoc files. Unauthenticated remote attackers can read arbitrary files on the server filesystem, including the sensitive `reposilite.db` SQLite database.

CVSS v3.1: 8.6 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).  
EPSS: 0.77573 (98.958th percentile).  
Fixed in 3.5.12; no known workarounds.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends one unauthenticated raw GET request to `/javadoc/releases/javadoc/1.0.0/raw/..%5c..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2freposilite.db` (encoded path traversal via the javadoc/raw endpoint). It confirms exploitation with DSL matchers requiring both `contains(body,"reposilite") && contains(body,"SQLite format")` and `contains(header, "application/octet-stream")`.
