## Vulnerability
LearnPress WordPress LMS Plugin before 4.2.7.1 (by Thimpress) is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL injection (CWE-89) via the `c_fields` parameter in the `/wp-json/learnpress/v1/courses` REST API endpoint (alias `/lp/v1/courses/archive-course`).  

Unauthenticated attackers can inject SQL payloads to extract arbitrary sensitive data from the backend database, including user credentials, course data, and personal information.  

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5).  

Remediation: update to 4.2.7.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw GET request  
`GET /wp-json/learnpress/v1/courses?c_fields=(SELECT(0)FROM(SELECT(SLEEP(6)))a) HTTP/1.1`  
and confirms the flaw when all three DSL conditions match: response duration ≥6 s (time-based blind injection success), `Content-Type` contains `application/json`, and body contains both `id":` and `name":` markers.
