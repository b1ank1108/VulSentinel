affected_product: LatePoint WordPress plugin
severity: critical
authentication: none

affected_versions: <= 5.0.11
preconditions: ["\"Use WordPress users as customers\" setting enabled (disabled by default; required for WordPress administrator account takeover)"]
poc_classification: state-change

## Vulnerability
The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection leading to arbitrary user password change in versions up to and including 5.0.11. Insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and lack of SQL query preparation allow unauthenticated attackers to modify passwords of plugin-managed customers (always possible) or WordPress users/administrators (when the setting is enabled).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first issues a GET to `{{BaseURL}}` and matches `status_code == 200` && `contains(body, "/wp-content/plugins/latepoint")` to fingerprint the plugin. It then sends a POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` using `action=latepoint_route_call&route_name=customer_cabinet__change_password` with a time-based blind SQLi payload (`password_reset_token[OR][ IS NULL or not (select sleep(8))) limit 1;-- -]`). Vulnerability is confirmed if `duration >= 8`, `status_code == 200`, `contains(body, "\"status\":\"error\"")` and JSON content-type.
