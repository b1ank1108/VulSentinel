## Vulnerability
FastChat (lm-sys/fastchat) 0.2.36 is affected by an open redirect vulnerability. Unauthenticated attackers can supply an arbitrary URL via the `file` parameter (e.g. `/file=https://evil.example`), causing the server to respond with a Location header pointing to the attacker-controlled domain. This enables phishing attacks and credential harvesting. Remediation requires updating to any version newer than 0.2.36.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` and internally matches the string `lm-sys/FastChat/` anywhere in the response body to confirm the target is FastChat. It then sends a second GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/file=https://interact.sh` and matches a regex on the Location header for a redirect containing `interact.sh` to verify the open-redirect condition.
