## Vulnerability
Stash versions prior to 0.26.0 contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the `sort` parameter in GraphQL queries. Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL (demonstrated via UNION SELECT on SQLite) to extract sensitive database contents such as version strings, schema details, or user/performer data. The flaw is present in the FindPerformers operation and requires no authentication or special configuration.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated POST to `/graphql` with a JSON payload injecting the payload `name;select performers.id FROM performers union select group_concat(sqlite_version(),':')-- -` into the `sort` field of a FindPerformers query. Detection succeeds if the response body contains the regex `converting driver\.Value type string \(\"3.*?\"\) to a int: invalid syntax` (indicating successful injection and leakage of the SQLite version via type-conversion error), the Content-Type is `application/json`, and the status is 200.
