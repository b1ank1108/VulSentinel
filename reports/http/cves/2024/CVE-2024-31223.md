## Vulnerability
Fides Privacy Center (part of Ethyca Fides) versions 2.19.0 to before 2.39.2rc0 exposes the `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` environment variable via an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the root Privacy Center endpoint. The value is returned directly in the JSON response body, leaking internal server configuration details such as private IPs, ports, and domain names. This information-disclosure issue (CWE-497) carries CVSS 3.1 score 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) and can assist attackers in mapping internal networks or crafting follow-on exploits. No authentication or special configuration is required beyond the vulnerable version; remediation is to upgrade to 2.39.2rc0 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}`, confirms HTTP 200 status, and matches the literal string "SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL" anywhere in the response body. A regex extractor then captures the full URL value from the JSON key for explicit confirmation of the leak.
