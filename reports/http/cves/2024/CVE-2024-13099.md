template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2024/CVE-2024-13099.yaml
affected_product: Widget4Call WordPress plugin
severity: medium
authentication: required
external_callback: false
affected_versions: <= 1.0.7
preconditions: [Widget4Call plugin installed and activated on WordPress; high-privilege user must visit crafted URL while logged in]
poc_classification: state-change
---

## Vulnerability
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in Widget4Call WordPress plugin <= 1.0.7. Unsanitized `_id` parameter is echoed on `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=w4c_devmode`, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser context of any logged-in high-privilege user who visits an attacker-crafted URL (CWE-79, CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N, score 5.4).  

Impact: account compromise, session hijacking, or unauthorized administrative actions performed via the victim's authenticated browser.  

Remediation: update to a version > 1.0.7.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

Template first POSTs supplied credentials to `/wp-login.php`, confirms successful login via `wordpress_logged_in` cookie in response headers (internal matcher), then sends GET `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=w4c_devmode&_id=1"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script><script>` and verifies status_code == 200 && body contains the exact unsanitized payload substring `></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script><script>`. Successful match confirms the parameter is reflected without escaping, proving the reflected XSS flaw that enables arbitrary client-side script execution (and therefore state-changing actions) in an admin context. Flow requires both requests to succeed.
