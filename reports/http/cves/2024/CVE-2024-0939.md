## Vulnerability
Critical arbitrary file upload (CWE-434) in Byzoro Smart S210 Management Platform up to firmware 20240117. The flaw resides in `/Tool/uploadfile.php` where the `file_upload` argument can be manipulated, enabling unrestricted uploads of arbitrary files (including executable PHP).

**CVSS:** 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**Impact:** Unauthenticated remote attackers upload malicious PHP scripts via the upload endpoint, execute arbitrary code on the server, and fully compromise the management platform plus any connected IoT devices.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to firmware newer than 20240117 implementing file-type validation, executable-upload blocks, and strict upload-directory controls.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs a direct two-step verification: (1) POST multipart/form-data to `/Tool/uploadfile.php` with a PHP payload `<?php print({{num1}}*{{num2}}); ?>` (random integers 800000-999999) saved as `/home/{{rand_text_alpha(5)}}.php`; (2) GET the uploaded file and matcher-confirms HTTP 200 with the exact precomputed multiplication result in the response body, proving successful arbitrary PHP execution on the target.
