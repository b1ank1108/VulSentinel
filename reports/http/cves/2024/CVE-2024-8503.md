## Vulnerability
VICIdial contains an unauthenticated time-based SQL injection vulnerability in VERM_AJAX_functions.php. An unauthenticated attacker can leverage this to enumerate database records. By default, VICIdial stores plaintext credentials within the database, which may lead to complete system compromise of the call center platform.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8) | CWE-89

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template fingerprints the target by sending a GET request to `/vicidial/welcome.php` and verifying the presence of strings indicating a VICIdial installation ("Agent Login", "Timeclock", "Administration"). It then issues a GET request to `/VERM/VERM_AJAX_functions.php?function=log_custom_report` with a crafted `Authorization: Basic` header containing a SQL injection payload that triggers `sleep(6)` on vulnerable instances. The vulnerability is confirmed if the response duration is 6 seconds or greater.
