## Vulnerability
RiteCMS 3.0.0 contains a reflected XSS vulnerability in the main_menu/edit_section component due to unsanitized user input. Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript payloads that execute in the victim's browser context. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Impact includes session hijacking and defacement. Remediation requires input sanitization in the affected component and upgrading to a patched version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first authenticates by sending POST /admin.php with username/password form data (matching on 302 redirect). It then sends POST /admin.php (mode=menus&menu=main_menu&edit_item=4) injecting the XSS payload (`'><svg/onload=console.log('{{rand_text_numeric(13)}}')`) into the name/title/link/section/accesskey/submenu fields. Finally it issues GET / and matches on the random string appearing in the HTML body (alongside "RiteCMS" and text/html content-type) to confirm the edit succeeded and the payload is rendered unsanitized.
