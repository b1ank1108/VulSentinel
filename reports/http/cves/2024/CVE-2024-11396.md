## Vulnerability
The Event Monster Event Management, Tickets Booking, Upcoming Event plugin for WordPress (<= 1.4.3) is vulnerable to information exposure. During visitors list export, a CSV file is created at the hardcoded, publicly accessible path `/wp-content/uploads/visitors-list.csv` in the wp-content folder. This exposes first/last names, email addresses, and phone numbers of event visitors to unauthenticated attackers (CVSS 5.3).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a GET to `/wp-content/plugins/event-monster/readme.txt`, extracts the Stable tag version via regex, and internally verifies `compare_versions(version, "<= 1.4.3")` along with plugin presence. It then issues a GET to `/wp-content/uploads/visitors-list.csv` and matches on the exact CSV header row `"First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Event"`, `text/csv` content-type, and HTTP 200 to confirm the leaked visitor data file.
