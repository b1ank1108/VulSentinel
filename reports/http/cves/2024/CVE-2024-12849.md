## Vulnerability
The Error Log Viewer By WP Guru WordPress plugin suffers from a missing authorization vulnerability in the `wp_ajax_nopriv_elvwp_log_download` AJAX action. All versions up to and including 1.0.1.3 are affected, enabling unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files on the web server via path traversal (CWE-22). This exposes sensitive data including configuration files with database credentials.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5 High). Remediation requires updating beyond 1.0.1.3.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The detection template first performs a GET / request with an internal DSL matcher to verify plugin presence (body contains "/wp-content/plugins/error-log-viewer-wp"). It then issues a POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php request with form data `action=elvwp_log_download&elvwp_error_log_download=1&elvwp_error_log=/etc/passwd`. Confirmation occurs if the response is status 200, Content-Type application/octet-stream, and body contains a root UID/GID regex match (`root:.*:0:0:`).
