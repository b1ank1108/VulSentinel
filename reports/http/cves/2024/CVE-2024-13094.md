## Vulnerability
WP Triggers Lite WordPress plugin v2.5.3 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via unsanitized `trigger_id` parameter on `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=add-trigger`. Attackers craft malicious URLs to execute JavaScript in the context of high-privilege (admin) users, enabling session hijacking or account compromise (CWE-79, CVSS 7.1).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first authenticates to WordPress by posting credentials to `/wp-login.php` (verifying 302 redirect with wordpress_logged_in cookie). It then issues a GET request to the vulnerable admin endpoint injecting the XSS payload `1"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script><script>` into the `trigger_id` query parameter. Detection succeeds if the response is 200 and the body reflects the unsanitized payload alongside "wp-triggers" string.
