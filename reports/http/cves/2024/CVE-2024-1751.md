## Vulnerability
Tutor LMS – eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress contains a time-based SQL Injection caused by insufficient escaping on the question_id parameter in SQL queries. All versions up to 2.6.1 are affected. Impact: attackers can extract sensitive database information through SQL injection, potentially leading to data breach or further exploitation. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). CWE-89. Remediation: update to version 2.6.2 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-step detection flow. First, a GET request to `/courses/` verifies the endpoint returns status 200 and contains `_tutor_nonce`, extracting the nonce value via regex. Second, a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` (timeout 30s) uses `action=load_filtered_instructor`, the extracted nonce, and injects the time-based payload `short_by=ASC,(SELECT SLEEP(7))-- -`. Matchers verify success if response duration >=7s, status_code==200, content_type contains application/json, and body contains "\"success\":true" or "tutor-instructor-list".
