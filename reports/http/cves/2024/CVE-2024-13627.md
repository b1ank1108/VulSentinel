## Vulnerability
**Affected Product**  
OWL Carousel Slider WordPress plugin (developed by wp-buy)

**Severity**  
medium

**CVE**  
CVE-2024-13627

**CWE**  
CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation - Cross-site Scripting)

**CVSS**  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L (Score: 4.7)

**Description**  
The OWL Carousel Slider WordPress plugin version 2.2 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS). The vulnerability originates from unsanitized output of a parameter on an admin page, allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the context of the victim's browser when a privileged user visits a specially crafted malicious URL.

**Impact**  
Attackers can execute arbitrary scripts in the browser session of high-privilege users (typically administrators), potentially leading to session hijacking, account compromise, unauthorized actions within the WordPress admin panel, or theft of sensitive data visible to the logged-in user.

signals
- affected_product: OWL Carousel Slider
- severity: medium
- authentication: required
- external_callback: false
- affected_versions: 2.2
- preconditions: [WordPress plugin installed and activated, attacker knows or can guess a valid slider ID (example uses id=1), attacker must trick a logged-in privileged user (e.g. administrator) into visiting the malicious URL]

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this reflected XSS vulnerability through a two-step HTTP flow:

1. Performs a login POST to `/wp-login.php` using provided `{{username}}` and `{{password}}` values to establish a valid authenticated session (verifies successful login via `wordpress_logged_in` cookie in response headers).
2. Sends a GET request to the plugin's admin edit page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpoc_edit&id=1">...</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script><script>`) using the authenticated session from step 1.
3. Checks whether the response status is 200 and whether the injected payload sequence appears **exactly and unescaped** in the response body (reflected without sanitization/encoding).

The presence of the unescaped injected script tags in the admin page output confirms the reflected XSS condition. Although the payload is harmless (alert with domain), the underlying flaw allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of any logged-in privileged user who can be socially engineered into opening the malicious link.
