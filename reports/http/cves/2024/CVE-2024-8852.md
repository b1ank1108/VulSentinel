## Vulnerability
All-in-One WP Migration and Backup WordPress plugin versions before 7.87 expose `/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/storage/error.log` publicly. Unauthenticated attackers can read the file, which may contain full server path disclosures, backup filenames, and other debugging details usable for follow-on attacks.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3)  
CWE-532

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

Template first issues GET to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/readme.txt`, extracts Stable tag version via regex, and internally verifies `< 7.87` with DSL matcher. On match it issues GET to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/storage/error.log` and confirms disclosure with `status_code == 200`, body containing both "Number" and "Message", plus `text/plain` Content-Type header.
