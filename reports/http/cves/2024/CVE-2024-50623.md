## Vulnerability
Cleo Harmony before 5.8.0.21, VLTrader before 5.8.0.21, and LexiCom before 5.8.0.21 contain an unrestricted file upload and download flaw (CWE-434) that could lead to remote code execution. The template focuses on the arbitrary file read (LFI/path traversal) vector. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 8.8). Impact includes system compromise via unauthorized file reads or uploads.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues two raw HTTP requests to `/Synchronization`. The first confirms a Cleo server (case-insensitive match on "cleo" in response) and extracts the `Server` header version for the second request. The second crafts a `VLSync: Retrieve;...;path=..\..\..\windows\win.ini` header to trigger path traversal and reads the Windows `win.ini` file. Detection succeeds when the body contains all of: "bit app support", "fonts", "extensions".
