## Vulnerability
Simple Certain Time to Show Content WordPress plugin before version 1.3.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2024-10152, CWE-79) due to lack of sanitization and escaping of the `tab` parameter in `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=simple-certain-time-to-show-content` before output to the page. An attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when visited by a high-privilege user (e.g., administrator), executes arbitrary JavaScript in that user's browser context. CVSS 3.1: 7.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L). Impact includes session hijacking or privilege escalation. Remediation: update to 1.3.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first performs authentication via POST to `/wp-login.php` using `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` and internally validates success with a `wordpress_logged_in` cookie plus HTTP 302 redirect. It then sends a GET request to the vulnerable admin endpoint injecting the payload `tab=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`. Detection confirms if status is 200 and body contains both the unsanitized payload string and the plugin identifier.
