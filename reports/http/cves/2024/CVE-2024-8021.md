## Vulnerability
Gradio is vulnerable to an open redirect bypass via URL encoding in the `/file` parameter. Attackers can craft malicious URLs (e.g., containing encoded external domains) that force the application to issue a redirect to phishing sites or attacker-controlled domains. This enables phishing attacks, credential theft, and loss of user trust. Remediation requires updating to a patched version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only
The template sends a single raw GET request `GET /file=http%3A%2F%2Foast.pro/ HTTP/1.1` (no authentication or additional headers) and verifies the vulnerability if the server responds with HTTP 302 and a Location header matching the regex for an oast.pro redirect.
