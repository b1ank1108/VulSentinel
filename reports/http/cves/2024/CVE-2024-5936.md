## Vulnerability
Open redirect (CWE-601, CVE-2024-5936) in PrivateGPT < 0.5.0 caused by unsanitized 'file' parameter. User-controlled input in the file query parameter is reflected directly into a Location header without validation, allowing an attacker to craft URLs that redirect victims to arbitrary external domains. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N (4.3/medium). Impact includes phishing campaigns and credential theft via malicious links pointing to the vulnerable /file= endpoint. Fixed by updating to 0.5.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues one unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/file=https://oast.me` and inspects the response headers with a regex matcher for any Location value containing oast.me, confirming the parameter is reflected unsanitized into a redirect.
