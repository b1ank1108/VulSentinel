## Vulnerability
Memos <=0.13.2 contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. An SSRF issue exists at the `/o/get/resource` endpoint (described as `/api/resource` in the advisory text) that permits forcing the server to issue arbitrary outbound requests, enabling internal network enumeration.  
Impact: Attackers can force the server to make requests to arbitrary destinations, potentially accessing internal services or sensitive data.  
Remediation: Update Memos to version 0.13.3 or later.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1)  
CWE: CWE-79

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/o/get/resource?url=https://{{interactsh-url}}` and verifies exploitation via DSL matchers requiring: (1) a DNS interaction on the interactsh domain (confirming the server performed an outbound request), (2) HTTP 200 status, and (3) the response body containing the string "memos". This OOB technique confirms the SSRF flaw without directly exfiltrating internal data in the probe itself.
