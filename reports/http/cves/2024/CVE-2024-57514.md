## Vulnerability
TP-Link Archer A20 v3 router web interface vulnerable to reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS, CWE-79) due to unsanitized directory listing paths. Crafted URL with embedded JavaScript payload in the path causes the server to render the payload directly into the generated "Index of" HTML page, executing arbitrary JS in the victim's browser context. Identified exclusively in firmware 1.0.6 Build 20231011 rel.85717(5553); fixed in all later builds. CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (base score 4.8). Authenticated attackers can weaponize this for session theft, phishing, or browser-based attacks.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/<style%20onload=alert`document.domain`;>../..%2f` and applies DSL matchers requiring all of: response body contains the exact unsanitized payload string "<style onload=alert`document.domain`;", contains "Index of", content-type includes "text/html", and status_code exactly 200. This confirms the path component is echoed verbatim into the directory-index HTML without escaping or filtering.
