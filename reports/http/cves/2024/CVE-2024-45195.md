## Vulnerability
Apache OFBiz below 18.12.16 is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution on Linux and Windows. An attacker with no valid credentials can exploit missing view authorization checks in the web application to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template detects the vulnerability by issuing a POST request to `/webtools/control/forgotPassword/xmldsdump` with form parameters that set `outpath` to the publicly accessible `./themes/common-theme/webapp/common-theme/` directory and request export of `UserLogin` and `CreditCard` entities into a randomly named `.txt` file. It then performs a GET request to `/common/{{filename}}.txt` and matches for `<?xml version=` plus `entity-engine-xml` in the body together with `text/plain` content-type to confirm the unauthorized dump action succeeded.
