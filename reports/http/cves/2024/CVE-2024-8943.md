## Vulnerability
LatePoint plugin for WordPress versions up to 5.0.12 contains an authentication bypass caused by insufficient verification of user during booking. This lets unauthenticated attackers log in as any existing user (including administrators) if they have a user ID and the 'Use WordPress users as customers' setting is enabled.

Impact: Attackers can log in as any existing user, including administrators, potentially leading to full site compromise.

Remediation: Update to version 5.0.13 or later.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8) | CWE-287.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first issues a GET request (clusterbomb) to the WordPress REST API users endpoint (`/wp-json/wp/v2/users` or `?rest_route=/wp/v2/users`) and extracts the first user's `id` and `name` via JSON matchers (publicly accessible in default configurations). It then sends a raw POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=latepoint_route_call&route_name=steps__load_step`, injecting the extracted `customer[id]` plus randomized email/password/first_name/last_name parameters. Success is confirmed if the response sets a `wordpress_logged_in_` cookie and returns `{"status":"success"}`.
