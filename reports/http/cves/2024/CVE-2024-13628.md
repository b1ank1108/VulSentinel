## Vulnerability
WP Pricing Table WordPress plugin <= 1.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79, CVE-2024-13628) caused by unsanitized output of the `table_id` parameter on the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-pricing-table-menu&action=new` endpoint. An attacker can craft a malicious URL embedding a payload that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the context of any high-privilege (administrator) user who visits the link. CVSS 3.1 score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Impact includes session hijacking and account compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs an internal login via POST to `/wp-login.php` using supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials and verifies the presence of a `wordpress_logged_in` cookie. It then sends a GET request to the vulnerable admin endpoint with the reflected payload injected into `table_id=1"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script><script>`. Success is confirmed when the response status is 200 and the response body contains both the exact unsanitized payload string and the string "wp-pricing-table".
