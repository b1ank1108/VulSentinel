## Vulnerability
WordPress HTML5 Video Player plugin (bplugins) for WordPress contains an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89) via the `id` parameter in the REST API endpoint `/?rest_route=/h5vp/v1/view/`. 

An attacker can inject malicious SQL to perform attacks leading to unauthorized database access, data leakage, or full site compromise. CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). The vendor did not acknowledge the issue; it was fixed in version 2.5.25.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends one raw GET request to `/?rest_route=/h5vp/v1/view/1` containing the time-based blind SQLi payload `id=1'+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(6)))a)--+-` (with 20s timeout) and matches on all three conditions: response duration >=6s, `application/json` in the header, and body containing both `created_at` and `video_id`.
