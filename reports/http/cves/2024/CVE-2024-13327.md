## Vulnerability
Musicbox WordPress plugin contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability caused by lack of sanitization and escaping of the `webdesignby-musicbox-filter` parameter before it is output on the page at `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=webdesignby-musicbox`. An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when visited by a logged-in high-privilege user, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context.
