## Vulnerability
The Avada theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to and including 7.11.6 via the publicly accessible `/wp-content/uploads/fusion-forms/` directory. Unauthenticated attackers can list the directory contents and extract sensitive files (personal information or confidential data) that were uploaded through any Avada-created form using the file upload mechanism.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/uploads/fusion-forms/` and confirms exposure when the response returns HTTP 200 with a directory index listing page (regex match on `<title>Index of` title tag) that also contains the string `fusion`.
