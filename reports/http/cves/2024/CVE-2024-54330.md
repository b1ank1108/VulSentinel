## Vulnerability
The Hurrakify plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in all versions up to, and including, 2.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application which can be used to query and modify information from internal services. Unauthenticated attackers can make arbitrary HTTP requests from the server to internal or external services, potentially accessing internal resources or performing port scanning. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 7.2), CWE-918.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The detection template confirms exploitability with an OOB SSRF probe:

- Initial request to `/` matches for the plugin signature (`/wp-content/plugins/hurrakify` in body, status 200) to confirm installation.
- Follow-up request to the vulnerable endpoint: `GET /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=hurraki_tooltip_proxy&target=http://{{interactsh-url}}`

Matchers verify the interactsh server received an HTTP callback with `text/html` content-type and 200 status, proving the server performed the requested outbound request.
