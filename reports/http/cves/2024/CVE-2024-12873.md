## Vulnerability
Custom Field Manager WordPress plugin through 1.0 is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The flaw stems from unsanitized and unescaped output of the `taxonomy` query parameter on the admin endpoint `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=custom-field-manager-customfields`. Attackers can supply a crafted URL containing a malicious payload that executes JavaScript in the browser context of high-privilege users (such as administrators) who visit the link. CVSS 3.1 score is 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N; CWE-79). Impact includes browser-based script execution that can lead to admin account compromise or unauthorized actions. Remediation requires updating the plugin to a version with proper sanitization and escaping.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first authenticates as a WordPress administrator by posting credentials to `/wp-login.php` and internally verifying the presence of a `wordpress_logged_in` cookie. It then sends a GET request to the vulnerable admin page with the reflected payload `testxss</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script><script>` embedded in the `taxonomy` parameter. Detection succeeds if the response is HTTP 200, content-type contains `text/html`, and the page body simultaneously contains both the unsanitized payload string and the plugin identifier `custom-field-manager`.
