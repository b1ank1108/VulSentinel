## Vulnerability
Ivanti vTM contains an authentication bypass (CVE-2024-7593, CWE-287) due to incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm. Remote unauthenticated attackers can bypass admin-panel authentication, achieving full administrative control and the ability to modify traffic-management configurations. CVSS 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Fixed in 22.2R1 and 22.7R2; all other versions are affected.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first issues a raw POST to `/apps/zxtm/wizard.fcgi?error=1&section=Access+Management%3ALocalUsers` that creates a new admin user (random 6-char username + 8-char password) and matches the internal string "wizardtitletext" in the response body. It then performs a multipart POST to `/apps/zxtm/login.cgi` using the newly created credentials and confirms successful authentication by verifying HTTP 302 redirect to `/apps/zxtm/`, plus the presence of both `Set-Cookie: ZeusTMZAUTH=` and `Set-Cookie: ZeusTMZAUTHTIME=` headers.
