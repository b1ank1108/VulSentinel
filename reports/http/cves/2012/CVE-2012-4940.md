## Vulnerability
Directory traversal (CWE-22) in the View Log Files component of Axigen Free Mail Server. Remote unauthenticated attackers can read or delete arbitrary files by injecting `..` sequences into the `fileName` parameter (download action to `/source/loggin/page_log_dwn_file.hsp` or edit/delete actions to default URI). CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N (6.4). Impact includes sensitive file disclosure leading to further compromise; remediation is vendor patch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues two GET requests (stop-at-first-match) that inject `..\..\..\windows\win.ini` via the `fileName` parameter into the log-file edit and download endpoints (with static `h=` hash and `page=vlf`/`action=edit|download`). It confirms exploitation by requiring all three strings ("bit app support", "fonts", "extensions") to appear in the response body.
