## Vulnerability
Open redirect vulnerability in `/assets/login` on Forescout CounterACT NAC device before 7.0. Remote unauthenticated attackers can supply an arbitrary URL in the `a` parameter, causing the application to issue a Location header redirect to that URL. This enables phishing attacks and malware distribution by tricking users into visiting malicious sites.  
CVSS v2: 5.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N) • CWE-20 • Reported against 6.3.4.1 / 6.3.4.10.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only  
The template sends a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/assets/login?a=https://interact.sh` and applies a regex matcher on the `Location` response header to confirm the supplied domain appears unsanitized. No credentials, no state changes, no data exfiltration, and no destructive payload are used; the check only validates the redirect behavior that proves the open-redirect flaw is present.
