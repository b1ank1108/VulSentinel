## Vulnerability

CVE-2012-1835 is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the All-in-One Event Calendar plugin versions 1.4 and 1.5 for WordPress. Multiple parameters across several PHP files in the plugin are vulnerable to XSS injection, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML without authentication. The vulnerable parameters include: the `title` parameter in `app/view/agenda-widget-form.php`; the `args`, `title`, `before_title`, and `after_title` parameters in `app/view/agenda-widget.php`; the `button_value` parameter in `app/view/box_publish_button.php`; and the `msg` parameter in `app/view/save_successful.php`. Successful exploitation could lead to malicious script injection, potentially resulting in data theft, session hijacking, or website defacement. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS 2.0 score of 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N).

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-stage detection process. First, it verifies the presence of the All-in-One Event Calendar plugin by requesting the `readme.txt` file at `/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/readme.txt` and checking for the string "All-in-One Event Calendar". If confirmed, it proceeds to test for XSS vulnerability by sending a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/agenda-widget.php` with a malicious payload in the `title` parameter: `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. The template confirms the vulnerability if the response body reflects the injected script payload, the response contains a `text/html` content-type header, and returns a 200 status code. This demonstrates that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the HTML output.
