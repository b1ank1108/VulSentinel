## Vulnerability
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `index.php` of the WP-FaceThumb 0.1 WordPress plugin. Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `pagination_wp_facethumb` GET parameter.

CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N (score 4.3)  
CWE-79  
Impact: Successful exploitation allows script injection into pages viewed by users, enabling theft of sensitive information (e.g. session cookies) or unauthorized browser actions.  
Remediation: Update to version 0.2 or higher with proper input sanitization.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs an internal GET to `/wp-content/plugins/wp-facethumb/readme.txt` and matches the word `WP-FaceThumb ===` to confirm plugin presence. It then sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/?page_id=1&pagination_wp_facethumb=1%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`, verifying the unsanitized payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` appears in the response body along with HTTP 200 status and `text/html` Content-Type.
