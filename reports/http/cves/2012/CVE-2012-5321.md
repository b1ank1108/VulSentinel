## Vulnerability
TikiWiki CMS Groupware v8.3 contains an open redirect / frame injection flaw in `tiki-featured_link.php`. The `url` parameter is reflected without validation, allowing remote attackers to force the application to load arbitrary external websites inside frames. 

Description: tiki-featured_link.php in TikiWiki CMS/Groupware 8.3 allows remote attackers to load arbitrary web site pages into frames and conduct phishing attacks via the url parameter, aka "frame injection".

Impact: Successful exploitation could lead to phishing attacks and potential unauthorized access to sensitive information.

CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N (score 5.8)  
CWE-20  
No authentication required.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues one unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/tiki-featured_link.php?type=f&url=https://interact.sh` and uses a regex matcher on the `Location` response header to confirm whether the server performs an open redirect to the supplied external domain.
