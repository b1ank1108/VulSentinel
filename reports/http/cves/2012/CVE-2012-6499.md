## Vulnerability
Open redirect vulnerability in `age-verification.php` of the Age Verification plugin v0.4 and earlier for WordPress. The `redirect_to` parameter is unsanitized, allowing remote attackers to supply arbitrary URLs and redirect users to malicious sites for phishing or malware distribution (CVSS 5.8, CWE-20).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template sends a single POST request to `/wp-content/plugins/age-verification/age-verification.php` containing `redirect_to=http://www.interact.sh&age_day=1&age_month=1&age_year=1970`. It verifies success by matching the `Location` response header for a redirect containing the `interact.sh` domain.
