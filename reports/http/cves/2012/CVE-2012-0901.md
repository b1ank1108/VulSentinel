## Vulnerability

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in `yousaytoo.php` of the YouSayToo auto-publishing plugin 1.0 for WordPress. Remote unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `submit` parameter.

**CVSS Score**: 4.3 (CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N, CWE-79)

**Impact**: Allows injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or website defacement.

**Remediation**: Upgrade to the latest version of the plugin.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template first sends a GET request to the base URL and uses an internal matcher to confirm the presence of the plugin by looking for its directory path string `/wp-content/plugins/yousaytoo-auto-publishing-plugin/` in the response. It then issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/yousaytoo-auto-publishing-plugin/yousaytoo.php?submit=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies exploitation conditions with AND matchers: the exact XSS payload appears unsanitized in the response body, Content-Type is `text/html`, and status code is 200. This confirms a reflected XSS flaw where user input is not properly escaped.
