## Vulnerability
11in1 CMS 1.2.1 (stable 12-31-2011) contains multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities (CWE-22). Remote unauthenticated attackers can read arbitrary files by supplying `..` (dot dot) sequences in the `class` parameter to `index.php` or `admin/index.php`.

CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N (score 5.0).  
Impact: Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive information (e.g. configuration files, source code), potential remote code execution via included malicious files, and full system compromise.  
Remediation: Upgrade to the latest version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template verifies the vulnerability by issuing a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?class=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` and checking for HTTP status 200 combined with a regex match for `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body, confirming that the system `/etc/passwd` file was successfully read via LFI.
