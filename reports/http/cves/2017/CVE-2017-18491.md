affected_product: Contact Form by BestWebSoft

## Vulnerability
Contact Form by BestWebSoft WordPress plugin before 4.0.6 contains multiple cross-site scripting issues. Authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, credentials, or performing actions on behalf of users. Remediation requires updating to version 4.0.6 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first POSTs credentials to `/wp-login.php` to authenticate as a valid WordPress user, then issues a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category=%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E` and verifies the unsanitized payload string appears verbatim in the HTML response body (confirming reflection). A third request to `/wp-content/plugins/contact-form-plugin/readme.txt` checks for the string "Contact Form by" to confirm the target plugin is present.
