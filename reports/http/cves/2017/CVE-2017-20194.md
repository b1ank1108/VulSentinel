## Vulnerability
The Formidable Form Builder plugin for WordPress exposes sensitive form data to unauthenticated attackers via the `frm_forms_preview` AJAX action. Any unauthenticated remote attacker can export all entries for any form on the site.  
Impact: full disclosure of all submitted form data (names, emails, messages, etc.), enabling data breaches and privacy violations.  
CVSS 3.1: 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) · CWE-200.  
Remediation: upgrade to 2.05.04 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/formidable/readme.txt`, extracts the version string from the "Stable tag:" line, and matches only when the version is < 2.05.03, the body contains "Formidable Forms", and the status code is 200. This passive fingerprint confirms a vulnerable installation without triggering the actual data-export endpoint.
