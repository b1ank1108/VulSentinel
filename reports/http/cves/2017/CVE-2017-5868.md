## Vulnerability
CRLF injection vulnerability in the web interface in OpenVPN Access Server 2.1.4 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and consequently conduct session fixation attacks and possibly HTTP response splitting attacks via "%0A" characters in the PATH_INFO to __session_start__/.

Impact: Attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers to conduct session fixation attacks, potentially hijacking user sessions or performing HTTP response splitting attacks.

Remediation: Update to the latest version of OpenVPN Access Server or apply vendor-provided security patches.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1), CWE-93.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/__session_start__/%0aSet-Cookie:%20crlfinjection=1;` and verifies success by matching a 302 status code together with the exact reflected `Set-Cookie: crlfinjection=1;` header in the response, confirming the CRLF payload successfully injected a controllable HTTP header.
