## Vulnerability
Kodi 17.1 is vulnerable to local file inclusion (CWE-22) due to insufficient validation of user input in the image handling endpoint. Unauthenticated remote attackers can read arbitrary files on the system (e.g. /etc/passwd), exposing sensitive information, credentials, and configuration files. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). Remediation: Upgrade Kodi to a version not affected by CVE-2017-5982.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/image/image%3A%2F%2F%2e%2e%252fetc%252fpasswd` (URL-encoded path traversal targeting /etc/passwd) and confirms exploitation via an AND matcher on HTTP status 200 combined with regex match for `root:[x*]:0:0` in the response body.
