## Vulnerability
OpenText Documentum Administrator 7.2.0180.0055 is affected by CVE-2017-14524 (CWE-601), an open redirect vulnerability. The flaw exists in the handling of the `startat` parameter on the `/xda/help/en/default.htm` endpoint, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to supply an arbitrary URL (including `//attacker-controlled-domain`) that the application reflects directly into a `Location` header. 

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Successful exploitation enables phishing, credential theft, malware delivery, or chained attacks that abuse user trust in the legitimate domain.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/xda/help/en/default.htm?startat=//oast.me` and applies a regex matcher on the `Location` response header to confirm a redirect containing `oast.me`. This verifies the open-redirect condition exists while remaining harmless to the target.
