## Vulnerability
The User Role by BestWebSoft WordPress plugin before version 1.5.6 contains multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript via unsanitized parameters such as `category` in the plugin's admin panel (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel`), leading to execution in victims' browsers with the victim's privileges. Potential impacts include session cookie theft, credential exposure, or impersonation of authenticated users.

**Impact:** Authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, credentials, or performing actions on behalf of users.  
**Remediation:** Update to version 1.5.6 or later.  
**CVSS:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)  
**CWE:** CWE-79

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` using the provided `{{username}}` and `{{password}}` values. It then issues a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category=%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E`, injecting a reflected XSS payload. Detection succeeds if the response body contains the unsanitized payload string `"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>">All</a></li>"` (confirming lack of output encoding). A final GET to `/wp-content/plugins/user-role/readme.txt` verifies the plugin presence via the string "User Role by BestWebSoft".
