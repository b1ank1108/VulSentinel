## Vulnerability

CVE-2017-18542 is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the Zendesk Help Center plugin by BestWebSoft for WordPress versions prior to 1.0.5. The vulnerability exists in multiple locations within the plugin and allows authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application. The flaw is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.0 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R) and has a changed scope (S:C), meaning the vulnerable component impacts resources beyond its security scope. Successful exploitation can lead to execution of malicious JavaScript in victims' browsers, potentially enabling session hijacking, credential theft, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs a three-step detection process:

1. **Authentication**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with WordPress credentials to establish an authenticated session
2. **XSS Probe**: Sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category=%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E` with an XSS payload injected into the `category` parameter
3. **Version Verification**: Retrieves `/wp-content/plugins/zendesk-help-center/readme.txt` to confirm the plugin presence

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking that:
- The XSS probe request returns HTTP 200 with `text/html` content type
- The response body reflects the injected payload: `"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>">All</a></li>`
- The readme.txt file contains "Zendesk Help Center by BestWebSoft"

This detection method verifies that unsanitized input is reflected in the admin panel, confirming the presence of a stored or reflected XSS vulnerability accessible to authenticated users.
