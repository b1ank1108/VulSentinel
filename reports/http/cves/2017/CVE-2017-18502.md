## Vulnerability
The Subscriber by BestWebSoft WordPress plugin versions before 1.3.5 contains multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Authenticated attackers can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into the plugin's admin interface (bws_panel page).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template first performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` with supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials. It then issues a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category=%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E`, verifying unsanitized reflection of the `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` payload in the HTML response body. A final request to `/wp-content/plugins/subscriber/readme.txt` confirms plugin presence via the string "Subscriber by".
