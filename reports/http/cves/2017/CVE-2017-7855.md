## Vulnerability
IceWarp WebMail 11.3.1.5 suffers from a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the `language` query parameter on the `/webmail/` endpoint. 

Unauthenticated remote attackers can craft a malicious URL containing an unescaped payload that is reflected verbatim into the page source, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of any victim who visits the link. 

CVSS 3.0: 6.1 (Medium)  
Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation  

Impact: session-cookie theft, credential harvesting, or actions performed on behalf of the authenticated victim.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/webmail/?language=%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert(document.domain)%3E` and verifies successful exploitation by confirming the exact reflected payload string appears in the response body (`lang=""><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`), the presence of the IceWarp product signature, a `text/html` Content-Type header, and HTTP 200 status. This confirms lack of input sanitization/encoding that enables reflected XSS.
