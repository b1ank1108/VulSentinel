## Vulnerability
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the social-login-bws WordPress plugin before 0.2.  
Reflected XSS occurs on the authenticated `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel` endpoint when the `category` GET parameter is reflected unsanitized into HTML output.  
CVSS 3.0: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). CWE-79.  
Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the context of a logged-in victim's browser, enabling session-cookie theft, credential exfiltration, or actions performed on behalf of the victim.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template first POSTs credentials to `/wp-login.php` to establish an authenticated session, then issues a GET request to the vulnerable admin endpoint embedding the payload `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the `category` parameter. Detection succeeds if the response body contains the exact unsanitized payload string and the plugin `readme.txt` confirms presence of "Social Login by". The probe uses a benign `alert()` to verify reflection without side effects.
