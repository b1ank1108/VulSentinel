## Vulnerability
SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java 7.5 is susceptible to local file inclusion in `scheduler/ui/js/ffffffffbca41eb4/UIUtilJavaScriptJS`. Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via a `..` (dot dot) in the query string, as exploited in the wild in August 2017 (SAP Security Note 2486657).

**Impact**  
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, and potential system compromise.

**Remediation**  
Apply the latest security patches and updates provided by SAP to fix the LFI vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java 7.5.

**Classification**  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5) • CWE-22 • CPE cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server_java:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

## PoC / Detection
