## Vulnerability
Error Log Viewer by BestWebSoft WordPress plugin (< 1.0.6) contains multiple reflected XSS issues in the admin bws_panel page. Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser context (same-site, authenticated session).  

Impact: session-cookie theft, credential exposure, or actions performed on behalf of the victim user.  
Remediation: update to 1.0.6 or later.  
CVSS 3.0: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE-79

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  

The template authenticates via POST /wp-login.php using supplied username/password, then issues a GET /wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category="></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script> to trigger reflected XSS. Detection succeeds when the exact unsanitized payload appears in the response body ("> </script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>\">All</a></li>"), confirming lack of output encoding. A final GET to the plugin readme.txt verifies the vulnerable component is present.
