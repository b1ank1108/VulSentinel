## Vulnerability
HPE Integrated Lights-out 4 (iLO 4) firmware versions prior to 2.53 contain an authentication bypass vulnerability that may also enable code execution. An unauthenticated remote attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the iLO management interface.

Impact: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the affected system.

CVSS: 10.0 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Remediation: Upgrade to version 2.53 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/rest/v1/AccountService/Accounts` with a specially crafted `Connection: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA` header. Detection succeeds if the response is HTTP 200 with `application/json` content-type and contains the string "iLO User" in the body, confirming access to account information without credentials.
