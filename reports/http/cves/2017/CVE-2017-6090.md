## Vulnerability
PhpCollab 2.5.1 and earlier contains an arbitrary file upload flaw (CWE-434) that permits remote users to upload files with executable extensions (e.g. `.php`) through the `clients/editclient.php` endpoint using a multipart POST request. The uploaded files are stored under `/logos_clients/` and can be accessed directly, leading to arbitrary PHP code execution.

**CVSS v3.0**: 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**EPSS**: 0.86913 (99.415th percentile)  
**Impact**: Full remote code execution on the server.  
**Remediation**: Upgrade beyond 2.5.1 or apply vendor patches.

## PoC / Detection
**Classification**: rce

The template verifies the flaw by issuing a multipart POST to `/clients/editclient.php?id={{randstr}}&action=update` that uploads a temporary PHP file containing `<?php echo md5("CVE-2017-6090");unlink(__FILE__);?>` (Content-Type: application/x-php), immediately followed by a GET to `/logos_clients/{{randstr}}.php`. It then asserts HTTP 200 and the presence of the computed MD5 hash in the second response body.
