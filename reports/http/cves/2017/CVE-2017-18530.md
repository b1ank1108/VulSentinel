## Vulnerability
Rating by BestWebSoft (rating-bws) WordPress plugin before version 0.2 contains multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) issues. Authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, credentials, or performing actions on behalf of users. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79. Remediation: update to version 0.2 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template authenticates by POSTing credentials to /wp-login.php, then issues a GET to /wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category=%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E and verifies the unsanitized payload reflection via the exact string `"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>\">All</a></li>"` in the HTML body (plus 200 status and text/html content-type). A final GET to /wp-content/plugins/rating-bws/readme.txt confirms plugin presence via the string "Rating by BestWebSoft".
