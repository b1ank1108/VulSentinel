## Vulnerability

Luracast Restler 3.0.1 via TYPO3 Restler 1.7.1 contains a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability (CWE-22) in `public/examples/resources/getsource.php`. Unauthenticated remote attackers can supply a `file` parameter with path traversal sequences (e.g. `../../../../../../../LocalConfiguration.php`) to read arbitrary files from the server filesystem, exposing sensitive data such as TYPO3 database credentials, encryption keys, and configuration.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5 High).  
Impact: full confidentiality breach; may enable further attacks if credentials are obtained.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/typo3conf/ext/restler/vendor/luracast/restler/public/examples/resources/getsource.php?file=../../../../../../../LocalConfiguration.php` and confirms exploitation success by matching HTTP 200 status plus the presence of `<?php`, `'host'`, `'database'`, `'extConf'`, and `'debug'` strings in the response body (indicating the TYPO3 configuration file was successfully included and rendered).
