## Vulnerability
Intelbras WRN 150 router is vulnerable to authentication bypass through cookie manipulation (CVE-2017-14942, CWE-552). Setting the `admin:language=pt` cookie allows unauthenticated access to download the full router configuration file (`RouterCfm.cfg`), exposing credentials, wireless settings (`wl_`), and other sensitive data. CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Impact includes potential full network compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single raw GET request to `/cgi-bin/DownloadCfg/RouterCfm.cfg` with the manipulated `Cookie: admin:language=pt` header. It confirms exploitation success via DSL matchers checking for HTTP 200 status, Content-Type containing 'config/conf', and body containing both 'wl_' and '_passwd' strings, which are indicative of the leaked configuration containing WiFi and password details.
