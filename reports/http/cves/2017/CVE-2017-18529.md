## Vulnerability
PromoBar by BestWebSoft WordPress plugin before version 1.1.1 is affected by multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) issues (CWE-79). The `promobar` plugin fails to sanitize/encode user-supplied input in the admin panel.

Authenticated attackers can craft malicious links that, when visited by logged-in victims, execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context. Impact includes session cookie theft, credential exposure, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim user.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (base score 6.1).  
Remediation: Update to version 1.1.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the reflected XSS by:
- Authenticating via POST to `/wp-login.php` using supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials.
- Issuing a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category="></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` to trigger the unsanitized reflection.
- Fetching `/wp-content/plugins/promobar/readme.txt` to confirm plugin presence.
- Matching on HTTP status 200, HTML content-type, exact reflected payload in the admin response body (`></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>">All</a></li>`), and plugin identifier string.
