## Vulnerability
Pagination by BestWebSoft < 1.0.7 for WordPress is vulnerable to multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues (CVE-2017-18527). Authenticated attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' browsers via the admin panel, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.

Severity: medium  
CVSS v3.0: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE: 79

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template authenticates to WordPress using provided credentials via POST to /wp-login.php. It then sends a GET request to /wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel with a crafted `category` parameter containing an XSS payload (`"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`). Detection succeeds if the payload is reflected unescaped in the response body. A final request to the plugin's readme.txt confirms the presence of the affected component.
