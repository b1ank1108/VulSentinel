## Vulnerability
Oracle GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 3.0.1 (build 22) is vulnerable to unauthenticated local file inclusion vulnerabilities that allow remote attackers to request arbitrary files on the server. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5, CWE-200).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/resource/file%3a///etc/passwd/` and verifies exploitation success via HTTP 200 status combined with regex match for `root:[x*]:0:0:` in the response body (confirming inclusion and disclosure of /etc/passwd).
