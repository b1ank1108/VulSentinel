## Vulnerability
Contact Form to DB by BestWebSoft WordPress plugin before 1.5.7 contains multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) issues (CWE-79). Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript via unsanitized parameters on admin pages such as bws_panel.

Impact includes execution of JS in victims' browser context, enabling theft of session cookies/credentials or actions performed on behalf of the user. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Remediation: update to 1.5.7 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

Template first POSTs credentials to /wp-login.php for authentication, then GETs /wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category=%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E to inject reflected XSS payload, and finally GETs the plugin readme.txt. Detection succeeds if response body_2 contains the exact unsanitized payload string `></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>">All</a></li>` (plus plugin string match).
