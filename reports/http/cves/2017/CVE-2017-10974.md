## Vulnerability
Yaws 1.91 web server is affected by an unauthenticated local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability (CWE-22) due to insufficient sanitization of traversal sequences (`/%5C../`) when processing requests (reported on port 8080). Remote attackers can read arbitrary local files such as the SSL private key at `ssl/yaws-key.pem`, resulting in information disclosure. 

CVSS 3.0: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). Impact includes exposure of sensitive server files and cryptographic material.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/%5C../ssl/yaws-key.pem` and verifies success via an AND matcher condition: HTTP 200 status, response body (lowercased) does not contain `<html>`, and body contains the literal string `BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY`.
