## Vulnerability
JIRA Workflow Designer Plugin in Atlassian JIRA Server before 6.3.0 uses an unsafe XML parser and Java deserializer in the AMF endpoint. Unauthenticated remote attackers can submit a crafted serialized object to achieve arbitrary code execution, arbitrary file read, or denial of service (CVSS 9.8, CWE-502). Successful exploitation can lead to full server compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first fingerprints an Atlassian JIRA instance by issuing GET requests to `/secure/Dashboard.jspa`, `/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa`, or `/login.jsp` and matching the string `title="JiraVersion"` in the response body. It then sends a single raw POST to `/plugins/servlet/jwd/amf/` containing a binary AMF message with an embedded XXE payload (`<!ENTITY % ext SYSTEM "http://{{interactsh-url}}/amf">`). The server is confirmed vulnerable when an HTTP interaction is observed on the interactsh callback domain.
