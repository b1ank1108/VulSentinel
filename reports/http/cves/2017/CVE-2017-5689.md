## Vulnerability
Intel Active Management platforms are susceptible to authentication bypass. A non-privileged network attacker can gain system privileges on provisioned Intel manageability SKUs (Intel Active Management Technology, Intel Standard Manageability, Intel Small Business Technology). A non-privileged local attacker can provision manageability features. Observed exclusively in firmware versions 6.x–11.6; versions before 6.x and after 11.6 are unaffected. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8). Impact: unauthorized access to Intel Active Management firmware leading to full system control.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass
The template performs two raw HTTP GET requests (first to `/`, second to `/hw-sys.htm`) with `digest-username: admin` and matches on the second response: HTTP status 200 AND body containing both "System Status" and "Active Management Technology".
