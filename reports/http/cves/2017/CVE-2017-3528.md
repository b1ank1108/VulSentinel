## Vulnerability
Oracle E-Business Suite 12.1.3/12.2.x (Oracle Applications Framework component, subcomponent Popup windows / lists of values / datepicker) contains an open redirect flaw. Unauthenticated remote attackers with HTTP network access can supply a malicious redirect parameter that is reflected unsanitized into page output. Exploitation requires victim interaction but can lead to unauthorized update/insert/delete access to framework data and significantly impact linked products. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N (5.4). CWE-601.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template sends one unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/OA_HTML/cabo/jsps/a.jsp?_t=fredRC&configName=&redirect=%2f%5cinteract.sh` and matches the literal string `noresize src="/\interact.sh?configName=` anywhere in the response body, confirming the supplied redirect URL is embedded and will be loaded by the client.
