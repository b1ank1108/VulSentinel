template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2017/CVE-2017-17562.yaml
affected_product: Embedthis GoAhead
severity: high
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: < 3.6.5
preconditions: CGI is enabled and a CGI program is dynamically linked
poc_classification: rce

## Vulnerability
Embedthis GoAhead web server before 3.6.5 allows remote code execution when CGI support is enabled and the CGI program is dynamically linked. An attacker can control environment variables (e.g., via LD_DEBUG) passed to the CGI binary, leading to arbitrary code execution.  
Impact: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.  
Remediation: Upgrade to Embedthis GoAhead 3.6.5 or later.  
CVSS: 8.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
CWE: CWE-20  
CPE: cpe:2.3:a:embedthis:goahead:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues a GET request to `/cgi-bin/{{endpoint}}?LD_DEBUG=help` (fuzzing 65 common CGI endpoint names such as `admin`, `login`, `status`, `webproc`, etc.) and requires a 200 status response containing both the strings "environment variable" and "display library search paths". This confirms the dynamic linker debug output is exposed, verifying the vulnerable CGI configuration that permits environment-variable-controlled RCE.
