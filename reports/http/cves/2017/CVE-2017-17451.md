## Vulnerability
WordPress Mailster plugin versions <=1.5.4 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the unsubscribe handler via the `mes` parameter to `view/subscription/unsubscribe2.php`.

Successful exploitation allows injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, enabling potential data theft or unauthorized actions.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues an internal GET to `/wp-content/plugins/wp-mailster/readme.txt` and matches for the word `WP Mailster =` to confirm plugin presence. It then sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/wp-mailster/view/subscription/unsubscribe2.php?mes=%3C%2Fscript%3E%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28123%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` and matches if the response body contains `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`, the header contains `text/html`, and status code is 200.
