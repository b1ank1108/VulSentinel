## Vulnerability
Google Analytics by BestWebSoft WordPress plugin (also known as bws-google-analytics) versions before 1.7.1 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The flaw is due to improper sanitization of the `category` parameter when accessing the plugin's admin panel at `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel`. Authenticated attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that executes in victims' browsers, enabling session hijacking, credential theft, or impersonation of users. Fixed in 1.7.1. CVSS:3.0 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template logs into the WordPress dashboard using supplied admin credentials via POST to `/wp-login.php`, then issues a GET request to the bws_panel page embedding the XSS test payload `"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the category parameter. It confirms exploitation potential by matching the exact unsanitized reflection of the script tag in the HTML body response and verifies the target plugin installation by fetching its readme.txt file.
