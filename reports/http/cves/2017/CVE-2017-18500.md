## Vulnerability
Social Buttons Pack by BestWebSof WordPress plugin before 1.1.1 suffers from multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) issues (CWE-79, CVSS 6.1). Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in victims' browsers, enabling session cookie theft, credential disclosure, or actions performed on behalf of authenticated users.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a login POST to /wp-login.php using provided credentials, then sends a GET request to /wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel containing a reflected XSS payload in the `category` parameter (`"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`), and verifies successful reflection by checking for the unsanitized script tag in the HTML response body. A final GET to the plugin's readme.txt confirms plugin presence and version context.
