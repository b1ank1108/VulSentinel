## Vulnerability
Contact Form Multi by BestWebSoft WordPress plugin before version 1.2.1 suffers from multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues due to unsanitized input in admin panel parameters (e.g. `category` on `bws_panel` page).  
Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the context of other logged-in users' browsers.  
Impact includes session cookie theft, credential exposure, or actions performed on behalf of victims.  
Remediation requires updating to version 1.2.1 or later.  
CVSS v3.0 score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template authenticates via POST to `/wp-login.php` using supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}`, then issues a GET to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category="><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies the payload is reflected unsanitized in the HTML response body. A final GET to `/wp-content/plugins/contact-form-multi/readme.txt` confirms plugin presence via the string "Contact Form Multi by".
