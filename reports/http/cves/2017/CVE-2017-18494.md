## Vulnerability
Custom Search by BestWebSoft (custom-search-plugin) WordPress plugin before 1.36 suffers from multiple reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issues. Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript via unsanitized input (e.g., the `category` parameter on the `bws_panel` admin page), executing in victims' browsers and potentially stealing session cookies, credentials, or performing actions on their behalf.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)  
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first POSTs to `/wp-login.php` with `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` to authenticate, then issues a GET to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category=%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E` and verifies the unsanitized payload reflects in the HTML body (specifically the breakout sequence followed by `">All</a></li>"`). A final GET to `/wp-content/plugins/custom-search-plugin/readme.txt` confirms the plugin presence via the string "Custom Search by".
