## Vulnerability
Magmi 0.7.22 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data (prefix) passed to the magmi-git-master/magmi/web/ajax_gettime.php URL.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1) | CWE-79

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser context, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information. Remediation requires upgrading to a patched version or applying security patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/magmi/web/ajax_gettime.php?prefix=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain);%3C/script%3E%3C` and matches on the unsanitized payload appearing in the response body, combined with HTTP status 200 and text/html content-type header. This confirms the reflected XSS condition.
