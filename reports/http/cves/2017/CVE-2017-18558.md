affected_product: Testimonials by BestWebSoft
severity: medium
authentication: required
external_callback: false
affected_versions: < 0.1.9
preconditions: WordPress with bws-testimonials plugin installed and activated; luring authenticated user to visit malicious admin URL
poc_classification: info-leak

## Vulnerability
Testimonials by BestWebSoft (bws-testimonials) WordPress plugin before 0.1.9 contains multiple reflected XSS flaws in the admin panel (page=bws_panel). User-controlled parameters such as `category` are inserted into HTML output without sanitization or encoding. Authenticated attackers can craft malicious links that execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a logged-in victim's browser (session cookies, credentials, or actions on behalf of the user).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first POSTs valid credentials to `/wp-login.php` to establish an authenticated session, then sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category=%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E` embedding a breakout payload. It verifies success by confirming HTTP 200, text/html content-type, and literal reflection of the unsanitized `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` string inside the response body (alongside a plugin-identification request to `/wp-content/plugins/bws-testimonials/readme.txt`).
