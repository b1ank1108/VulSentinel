## Vulnerability

CVE-2017-18532 is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the Realty plugin by BestWebSoft for WordPress in versions prior to 1.1.0. The vulnerability exists due to multiple XSS issues within the plugin that allow authenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of victims who view the affected pages.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.0 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). The attack vector is network-based with low attack complexity, requires no privileges but does require user interaction, and has a changed scope with low impact to confidentiality and integrity.

Authenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute malicious JavaScript in victims' browsers, potentially leading to session cookie theft, credential harvesting, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability through a three-step process:

1. **Authentication**: The template first authenticates to the WordPress installation by sending a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with valid credentials (username and password parameters).

2. **XSS Payload Injection**: After successful authentication, it sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel` with a crafted XSS payload in the `category` parameter: `"><\/script><script>alert(document.domain)<\/script>`. This payload attempts to break out of the existing HTML context and inject a JavaScript alert.

3. **Version Verification**: The template retrieves the plugin's `readme.txt` file from `/wp-content/plugins/realty/readme.txt` to confirm the presence of the Realty plugin.

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking that:
- The XSS payload is reflected in the response body without proper sanitization
- The response contains the injected script tag with the alert function
- The readme file confirms the plugin identity as "Realty by BestWebSoft"
