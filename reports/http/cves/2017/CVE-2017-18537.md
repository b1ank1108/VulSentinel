## Vulnerability
The Visitors Online by BestWebSoft (visitors-online) WordPress plugin before 1.0.0 contains multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Unsanitized user input (e.g. the `category` query parameter) is reflected in the `bws_panel` admin page without HTML escaping. Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in victims' browsers (in the context of an active admin session), enabling session-cookie theft, credential exfiltration, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79. Remediation: update to version 1.0.0 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template authenticates by POSTing supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials to `/wp-login.php`. It then sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bws_panel&category=%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E`, which injects a reflected XSS payload. Detection confirms the vulnerability if the raw payload string appears unencoded in the HTML response body (next to the expected link text) and the plugin's `readme.txt` is reachable, verifying the component is present.
