## Vulnerability
NETGEAR R8500, R8300, R7000, R6400, R7300, R7100LG, R6300v2, WNDR3400v3, WNR3500Lv2, R6250, R6700, R6900, and R8000 devices are susceptible to authentication bypass via simple crafted requests to the web management server (CWE-200).  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 8.1).  
Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized configuration changes, network compromise, and potential exposure of sensitive information.  
Remediation requires the latest firmware update from NETGEAR.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/passwordrecovered.cgi?id={{rand_base(5)}}` and matches for HTTP status 200 combined with the response body containing both `right\">Router\s*Admin\s*Username<` and `right\">Router\s*Admin\s*Password<` strings (AND condition). This directly verifies the bypass is present by confirming the admin credential recovery page is accessible and leaks the fields without authentication.
