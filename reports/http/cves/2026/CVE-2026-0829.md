## Vulnerability
Frontend File Manager Plugin (nmedia-user-file-uploader) WordPress plugin through 23.5 contains an open relay and unauthorized file access vulnerability caused by lack of authentication and security checks in its AJAX callbacks (notably `wpfm_send_file_in_email` in callback-functions.php). Unauthenticated attackers can send emails (including attached files) and access sensitive uploaded files.  

**Impact:** Unauthenticated attackers can send spam emails and access sensitive uploaded files, leading to information disclosure and abuse of email functionality.  
**Remediation:** Update to the latest version beyond 23.5.  
**CVSS:** 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  
**CWE:** CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/nmedia-user-file-uploader/readme.txt` to extract the Stable tag version via regex and internally confirms `compare_versions(version, "<= 23.5")`. It then sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded) containing `action=wpfm_send_file_in_email&file_id=1&emailaddress=<rand5>@<rand5>.com&message=<rand5>`. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200, `application/json` Content-Type header, and body containing both `"success":true` and `"data":"File is shared successfully"`. This verifies the missing authorization on the file-sharing-via-email endpoint, enabling exfiltration of any file_id-controlled upload.
