## Vulnerability
Adminer 4.6.2 through 5.4.1 suffers from an unauthenticated persistent denial-of-service (CVE-2026-25892) due to missing origin validation on the version-check endpoint. Crafted POST requests trigger repeated server errors, rendering the application unavailable to all users. No authentication, special privileges, or configuration changes are needed. CVSS 3.1 score 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H), CWE-20. Fixed in 5.4.2.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: dos  
The template issues GET requests to `/adminer.php`, `/editor.php`, and `/adminer/`, follows redirects, and stops at the first match. It verifies the page contains “Adminer” in the title or link (status 200) and extracts the version via regex `<span class="version">([0-9.]+)`. A DSL matcher then confirms the version satisfies `>=4.6.2` and `<=5.4.1`. No exploitation payload is sent; detection is purely fingerprint-based.
