# CVE-2026-21877

## Vulnerability

n8n contains an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability (CWE-434) caused by arbitrary file write via the Git node. An authenticated user with access to workflow creation/editing can exploit the Git node functionality to overwrite arbitrary files on the n8n server filesystem. This allows overwriting application code, configuration files, or injecting malicious payloads that lead to execution of attacker-controlled code in the n8n process context. Successful exploitation can result in full server compromise, including access to stored credentials, API tokens, OAuth secrets, database connections, and all connected downstream systems.

The issue affects both self-hosted deployments and n8n Cloud instances when the vulnerable versions are in use.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template performs passive fingerprinting and version detection only — it does **not** attempt to exploit or demonstrate the arbitrary file write / code execution.

It sends a single GET request to `/signin` and checks for:
- HTTP 200 status
- Presence of `<title>n8n.io` (case-insensitive) in the response body to confirm the target is an n8n login page
- Extraction of a base64-encoded configuration blob from a specific meta tag
- Decoding and regex extraction of the exact n8n version string (semver format)
- DSL matcher that flags the instance as vulnerable if the extracted version satisfies `>= 0.123.0` and `< 1.121.3`

This is a safe, non-intrusive detection template that reliably identifies vulnerable instances without triggering any destructive or state-changing behavior.
