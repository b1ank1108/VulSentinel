## Vulnerability
n8n versions >= 0.123.0 and < 1.121.3 contain a critical authenticated remote code execution vulnerability via arbitrary file write. An authenticated user can exploit the Git node to overwrite critical files and execute untrusted code on the n8n server, leading to full system compromise. Affects both self-hosted and n8n Cloud instances. Impact includes access to all credentials, API tokens, OAuth secrets, database connections, and workflow automation capabilities. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.9), CWE-434. Remediation: upgrade to v1.121.3 or later; alternatively disable the Git node and limit access for untrusted users.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template passively fingerprints vulnerable instances with a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/signin`. It matches the page title containing "n8n.io", extracts a base64-encoded `n8n:config:sentry` meta tag, decodes it, parses the embedded `n8n@X.Y.Z` version string, and applies `compare_versions` to confirm the range >= 0.123.0 and < 1.121.3. No actual exploit payload or file-write step is performed.
