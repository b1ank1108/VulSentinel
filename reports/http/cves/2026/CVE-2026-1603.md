## Vulnerability
Ivanti Endpoint Manager < 2024 SU5 is affected by an authentication bypass (CWE-288) due to improper access control. Remote unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication and leak stored credential data with no special privileges or configurations required. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 8.6). Impact: potential exposure of sensitive credentials.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a single raw POST request to `/RemoteControlAuth/api/Auth` using the JSON body `{"logintype":"64","username":"administrator"}`. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 status when the body contains the key `"sessionid":` with a non-null value (negative matcher excludes null sessionid). The `sessionid` value is extracted via JSON extractor.
