## Vulnerability
Langflow < 1.3.0 contains a remote code execution vulnerability caused by inclusion of functionality from untrusted control sphere in the exec_globals parameter at the validate endpoint, letting remote attackers execute arbitrary code as root.

**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE:** CWE-94  
**Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code as root, leading to full system compromise.  
**Remediation:** Update to the latest version of Langflow.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first performs a POST to `/api/v1/login` with hardcoded default credentials (langflow/langflow) to extract an access_token via regex. It then issues a POST to `/api/v1/validate/code` (with `Authorization: Bearer {{token}}`) containing a malicious Python payload that embeds `subprocess.run('cat /etc/passwd', ...)` inside an exception-throwing lambda. Success is confirmed by a regex match for `root:.*:0:0:` in the JSON response body (plus 200 status and application/json content-type).
