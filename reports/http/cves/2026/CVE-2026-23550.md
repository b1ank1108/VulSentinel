# CVE-2026-23550

## Vulnerability

Modular DS (also referred to as Modular Connector / modular-connector WordPress plugin) suffers from a **broken access control** vulnerability due to incorrect privilege assignment. This allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access to sensitive administrative functions or data.

The flaw is present in versions up to and including 2.5.1. Updating to a version beyond 2.5.1 resolves the issue.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to one of two API-like endpoints:

- `/index.php/api/modular-connector/login/<random_string>?origin=mo&type=foo`
- `/api/modular-connector/login/<random_string>?origin=mo&type=foo`

It considers the vulnerability present if **both** of the following are true:

- HTTP status code is 302 (redirect)
- The `Set-Cookie` header contains a cookie named `wordpress_logged_in_…` (indicating a successful WordPress login session was created)

This pattern shows the endpoint incorrectly authenticates the request as a privileged user (most likely an administrator) and issues a valid logged-in session cookie without any credentials or prior authentication step.
