affected_product: ZimaOS
severity: critical
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: <= 1.5.0
preconditions: knowledge of common usernames for system service accounts (e.g. root)
poc_classification: auth-bypass

## Vulnerability
ZimaOS <= 1.5.0 contains a broken authentication vulnerability (CWE-287) due to improper password validation for known system service accounts in the `/v1/users/login` function. Attackers who know a common username (e.g. `root`) can authenticate using any password, gaining authenticated access to those accounts. CVSS 3.1 score 9.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L). Impact includes potential full system compromise via service-account access.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a single unauthenticated POST request to `{{RootURL}}/v1/users/login` with JSON payload `{"username": "root", "password": "anything"}`. It verifies exploitation by matching HTTP 200 status, `application/json` Content-Type, and response body containing the words `success`, `username`, and `created_at`.
