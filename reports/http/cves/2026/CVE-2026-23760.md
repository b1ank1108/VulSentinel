# CVE-2026-23760

## Vulnerability

Unauthenticated password reset vulnerability in the SmarterMail administrative interface. Allows an attacker to force a password change for the built-in "admin" account (or potentially other administrative accounts) by sending a crafted POST request to `/api/v1/auth/force-reset-password` with `IsSysAdmin` set to `true`. Successful exploitation grants the attacker full administrative control over the SmarterMail instance, including email server configuration, user management, and system settings.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a direct, unauthenticated POST request to `/api/v1/auth/force-reset-password` containing:
- `IsSysAdmin: "true"`
- `Username: "admin"`
- Arbitrary `OldPassword`
- Randomly generated `NewPassword` / `ConfirmPassword`

Detection relies on a 200 OK response containing both `"success":true` and the string `debugInfo` in the body. If these conditions are met, the template considers the endpoint vulnerable and the password reset successful. The new password is extractable via the DSL extractor for reporting / verification purposes.

The underlying vulnerability is an authorization bypass / missing permission check on the force-reset-password administrative API endpoint.
