## Vulnerability
SmarterMail (SmarterTools) contains CVE-2026-23760: an unauthenticated administrative password reset flaw in the `/api/v1/auth/force-reset-password` endpoint. Attackers can reset the built-in 'admin' account to an arbitrary password with no credentials or authorization required, enabling full administrative compromise of the mail server.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template sends a single raw POST request to `/api/v1/auth/force-reset-password` containing JSON with `IsSysAdmin:true`, `Username:admin`, a randomly generated 12-character alphanumeric `NewPassword` (and matching `ConfirmPassword`), plus dummy `OldPassword`. It asserts success via combined matchers on HTTP 200 status and response body containing both `"success":true` and the literal string `debugInfo`. The newly set password is extracted via DSL extractor for immediate reporting. This actively performs the password reset on the target.
