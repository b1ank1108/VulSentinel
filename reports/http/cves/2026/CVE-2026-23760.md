# CVE-2026-23760

- template_path: `nuclei-templates/http/cves/2026/CVE-2026-23760.yaml`
## Signals
- severity: critical
- auth_requirement: none
- oast_required: false
- version_constraints: unknown
- feature_gates: []

## Vulnerability
Unauthenticated HTTP POST request to `/api/v1/auth/force-reset-password` endpoint with hardcoded `"IsSysAdmin":"true"` and `"Username":"admin"` allows changing the administrator password to an attacker-controlled value. Successful response (`"success":true`) confirms the password was reset. The endpoint appears to lack proper authorization checks, enabling full admin takeover without credentials or prior access.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: intrusive

The template performs an active, state-modifying exploitation: it sends a single POST request that changes the `admin` account password to a randomly generated value. Success is confirmed via response body content and HTTP 200 status. The action is destructive (overwrites admin credentials) and has permanent side effects unless manually reverted.

Tags (`intrusive`, `auth-bypass`) align with this classification.
