# CVE-2026-21858

- template_path: `nuclei-templates/http/cves/2026/CVE-2026-21858.yaml`

## Signals

- severity: critical
- auth_requirement: none
- oast_required: false
- version_constraints: >=1.65.0, <1.121.0
- feature_gates: []

## Vulnerability

n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Versions starting with 1.65.0 and below 1.121.0 enable an attacker to access files on the underlying server through execution of certain form-based workflows. A vulnerable workflow could grant access to an unauthenticated remote attacker, resulting in exposure of sensitive information stored on the system and may enable further compromise depending on deployment configuration and workflow usage. This issue is fixed in version 1.121.0.

## PoC / Detection

This nuclei template performs a detect-only check. It fingerprints n8n via the `/signin` page, extracts an embedded version string, and flags targets as vulnerable when the version is within the affected range. It does not execute workflows or achieve code execution by itself.

Steps:

1. Send `GET {{BaseURL}}/signin`.
2. Extract the `<meta name="n8n:config:sentry" content="...">` value (base64).
3. Base64-decode the value and regex-extract the embedded n8n version.
4. Confirm the response looks like n8n (`<title>n8n.io`) and status is `200`.
5. Compare version against `>=1.65.0` and `<1.121.0`; if matched, report vulnerable.

## Remediation

Update to version 1.121.0 or later.

## Impact

Unauthenticated remote attackers can access sensitive files, potentially leading to information disclosure and further system compromise.
