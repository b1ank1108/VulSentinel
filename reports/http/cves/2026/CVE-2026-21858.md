## Vulnerability
n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Versions >= 1.65.0 and < 1.121.0 enable an attacker to access files on the underlying server through execution of certain form-based workflows. A vulnerable workflow could grant access to an unauthenticated remote attacker, resulting in exposure of sensitive information stored on the system and may enable further compromise depending on deployment configuration and workflow usage. This issue is fixed in version 1.121.0.

CVSS: 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)  
CWE: CWE-20

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/signin`. It extracts base64 content from the `<meta name="n8n:config:sentry" content="...">` tag, decodes it internally, then applies regex replacement to parse the n8n version string. Matchers require the response body title to contain "n8n.io" (case-insensitive), HTTP status 200, and the parsed version to satisfy `compare_versions(version, '>= 1.65.0', '< 1.121.0')`.
