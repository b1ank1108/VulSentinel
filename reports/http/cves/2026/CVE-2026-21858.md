# CVE-2026-21858

## Vulnerability

Unauthenticated remote code execution in n8n via specially crafted form-based workflows that allow arbitrary file access on the underlying server. The flaw enables an attacker to read sensitive files without authentication, which — depending on workflow configuration, filesystem permissions, and deployment context (especially self-hosted instances) — can lead to full system compromise through credential leakage, private key exposure, configuration file disclosure, or chained exploitation.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (10.0)

Root cause classified under CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), but manifests as unauthenticated file disclosure with potential for RCE escalation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template performs passive fingerprinting and version detection only. It sends a single GET request to `/signin`, extracts a base64-encoded configuration blob from a `<meta name="n8n:config:sentry">` tag, decodes it, uses regex to pull the n8n semantic version string, and then compares that version against the known affected range (>= 1.65.0, < 1.121.0) using `compare_versions()`. No active exploitation, payload submission, file access attempt, or workflow triggering occurs.
