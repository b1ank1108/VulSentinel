affected_versions: 3.0 and 3.1
preconditions: [Snoop servlet deployed in examples webapp]

## Vulnerability
Jakarta Tomcat 3.1 and 3.0 under Apache expose sensitive system information via the Snoop servlet. A remote unauthenticated attacker can trigger disclosure by requesting any nonexistent URL ending in `.snp` (e.g. `/examples/jsp/snp/anything.snp`). Returned data includes request details, path info, server name, and remote address. CVSS 2.0 score 6.4 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N). Impact: reconnaissance aid for follow-on attacks.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/examples/jsp/snp/anything.snp` and confirms the vulnerability when the response returns status 200 containing all of the following strings simultaneously: "Request Information", "Path info", "Server name", "Remote address".
