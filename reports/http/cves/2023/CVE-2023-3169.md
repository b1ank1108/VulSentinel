## Vulnerability
tagDiv Composer plugin versions before 4.2 for WordPress are vulnerable to unauthenticated stored XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript via the `compiled_css` parameter in a POST to `/wp-json/tdw/save_css`; the payload is stored server-side and executes for any visitor when the CSS loads (e.g. on the homepage).  
Impact: arbitrary JS execution in visitor context (session theft, defacement, keylogging).  
CVSS: 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, CWE-79).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template demonstrates the flaw with two sequential HTTP requests:  
1. POST `/wp-json/tdw/save_css` (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded) containing `compiled_css=</style><script>console.log({{rand_text_numeric(13)}})</script><style>`; matcher confirms 200 OK, empty body, JSON content-type.  
2. GET `/` (following redirects) and matcher confirms the exact injected `<script>console.log(...)` string appears unsanitized in the HTML body inside the `tdw-css-placeholder` element (content-type text/html).  
This proves unauthenticated persistent modification of served page content.
