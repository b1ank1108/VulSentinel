## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-35082 is a remote unauthenticated API access vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core. The vulnerability stems from permissive entries in the mifs web application's security filter chain, similar to CVE-2023-35078. This flaw allows remote attackers to access sensitive API endpoints without authentication, enabling unauthorized access to administrative data including user information. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating critical severity. Remote attackers can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and perform malicious actions.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by attempting to access the administrative users API endpoint at `/mifs/asfV3/api/v2/admins/users` without providing any authentication credentials. The detection verifies successful exploitation by checking for:
- Response body containing JSON fields indicating user data: 'results', 'userId', and 'name'
- Content-Type header indicating JSON response ('application/json')
- HTTP 200 status code indicating successful access

The template limits response size to 100 bytes to minimize data exposure during testing. A successful match confirms that the API endpoint is accessible without authentication, exposing administrative user information.
