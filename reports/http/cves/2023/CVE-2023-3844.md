## Vulnerability
MooDating 1.2 (mooSocial) is affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability (CWE-79, CVE-2023-3844) in an unknown functionality of the URL Handler component at the /friends endpoint. Improper sanitization of URL parameters allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious JavaScript. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Impact includes injection of JS to steal user session cookies and access personal profile information. Fixed in versions newer than 1.2.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/friendsslty3%22%3e%3cimg%20src%3da%20onerror%3dalert(document.domain)%3er5c3m/ajax_invite?mode=model` containing a reflected XSS payload. Detection succeeds if the response meets all three conditions: HTTP status 404, Content-Type containing "text/html", and response body containing both the unsanitized payload string `"><img src=a onerror=alert(document.domain)>r5c3m` and the string `mooDating`.
