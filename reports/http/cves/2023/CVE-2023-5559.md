## Vulnerability
The 10Web Booster WordPress plugin before 2.24.18 does not validate the option name given to some AJAX actions, allowing unauthenticated users to delete arbitrary options from the database. This leads to denial of service and potential site malfunction. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H (9.1).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template detects the vulnerability through a three-step process. It first probes the WordPress REST API (using /wp-json or ?rest_route=/) to confirm site structure and JSON response containing name/description. It then issues a POST request to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with action=two_activate_score_check and nonce=blogname to trigger deletion of the blogname option. Finally, it re-probes the REST API and verifies exploitation success by checking for "name":false in the response body.
