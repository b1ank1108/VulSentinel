## Vulnerability
Adobe ColdFusion versions 2018u16 (and earlier), 2021u6 (and earlier) and 2023.0.0.330468 (and earlier) are affected by a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability (CWE-502) that could result in arbitrary code execution. Exploitation does not require user interaction.  
Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template sends a single raw POST request to `///CFIDE/adminapi/accessmanager.cfc?method=foo&_cfclient=true` containing a WDDX packet with an embedded `JdbcRowSetImpl` object whose `dataSourceName` is set to an LDAP JNDI URL (`ldap://{{interactsh-url}}/rcrzfd`). Detection confirms the vulnerability when an OOB DNS interaction is received on the interactsh server and the response body contains the string "ColdFusion documentation".
