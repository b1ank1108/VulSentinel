## Vulnerability

STAGIL Navigation for Jira Menu & Themes plugin versions prior to 2.0.52 contain a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the `snjCustomDesignConfig` endpoint. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of the `fileName` parameter, allowing attackers to traverse directories and read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The flaw is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) with a CVSS score of 7.5 (High severity). The vulnerability requires no authentication (CVSS:3.1 PR:N) and can be exploited remotely over the network with low attack complexity. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive configuration files, including database credentials and other system files that could facilitate further attacks.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the `/plugins/servlet/snjCustomDesignConfig` endpoint with a malicious `fileName` parameter value of `../dbconfig.xmlpasswd`. The request attempts to traverse directories using path traversal sequences to access the Jira database configuration file. The template also includes a `fileMime` parameter set to `$textMime` to control the response content type.

The detection confirms successful exploitation through three conditions:
1. The response body contains the string `<jira-database-config>`, indicating successful retrieval of the Jira database configuration file
2. The response header contains `$textMime`, confirming the MIME type manipulation worked
3. The HTTP response status is 200, indicating successful file access

This proof-of-concept demonstrates the ability to read sensitive configuration files containing database credentials and other critical system information.
