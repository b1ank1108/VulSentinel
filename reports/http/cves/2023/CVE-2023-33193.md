## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-33193 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Emby Server, a user-installable home media server for organizing and streaming media files. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication by spoofing HTTP headers intended for reverse proxy interoperation (specifically `X-Forwarded-For`). By manipulating these headers, attackers can affect the local/non-local network determination logic, enabling them to log in without a password or enumerate user accounts that have no password configured.

The flaw stems from improper handling of proxy headers (CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests), allowing attackers to masquerade as local network clients and bypass authentication controls. This grants unauthorized administrative access to publicly accessible Emby Server instances where administrators have not properly secured account login configurations. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.1 (Critical) with high confidentiality and integrity impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the `/emby/users/public` endpoint with a spoofed `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header. This header manipulation tricks the server into treating the request as originating from the local network, bypassing authentication requirements.

The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for:
- A JSON response containing user account information fields: `"Name":`, `"ServerId":`, `"HasPassword":`, and `"Configuration":`
- Content-Type header indicating `application/json`
- HTTP 200 status code

A positive match indicates the server is vulnerable to authentication bypass, as it returns sensitive user account data (including password status) without requiring authentication when the local network spoofing is successful.
