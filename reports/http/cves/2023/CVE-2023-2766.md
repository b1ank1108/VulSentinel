## Vulnerability
A vulnerability was found in Weaver OA 9.5 and classified as problematic (CWE-552). It affects unknown processing of the file `/building/backmgr/urlpage/mobileurl/configfile/jx2_config.ini`. The issue allows remote manipulation leading to files or directories becoming accessible. An attacker can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information including database credentials (`sdbuser` and `sdbpassword`). CVSS 3.1 score 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/building/backmgr/urlpage/mobileurl/configfile/jx2_config.ini` and confirms successful disclosure when all three conditions match: HTTP status 200, `Content-Type` header containing `text/plain`, and response body containing both `sdbuser =` and `sdbpassword =`.
