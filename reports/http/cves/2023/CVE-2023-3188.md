## Vulnerability
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CVE-2023-3188) in Owncast prior to version 0.1.0. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit the `account` parameter in POST requests to the `/api/remotefollow` endpoint, forcing the server to issue arbitrary HTTP/DNS requests to attacker-specified internal or external targets. This enables internal network service probing and potential access to sensitive resources. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.5). CWE-918. Remediation requires updating to 0.1.0 or later with address validation and domain restrictions on remote follow requests.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single POST request to `/api/remotefollow` containing the JSON body `{"account":"a@{{interactsh-url}}"}`. Detection succeeds when an out-of-band interaction (HTTP or DNS callback to interactsh) is observed together with a JSON response body containing both `success":` and `message":` keys and a `application/json` content-type header. The probe is non-destructive and only confirms SSRF reachability.
