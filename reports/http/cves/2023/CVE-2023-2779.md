## Vulnerability
Super Socializer (Heator) WordPress plugin versions before 7.13.52 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS, CWE-79). The `the_champ_sharing_count` AJAX endpoint fails to sanitize/escape the `urls` parameter before reflecting it in the HTML response.  

Unauthenticated attackers can craft malicious links that, when visited by logged-in high-privilege users (e.g. administrators), execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context. Impact includes theft of session cookies and administrator credentials.  

CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Fixed in 7.13.52.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` using supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials. It then issues a GET to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=the_champ_sharing_count` embedding a reflected XSS payload in the `urls` parameter (`urls[%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert%28document%2Edomain%29%3E]=https://oast.pro`).  

Detection succeeds when the response meets all three conditions: HTTP 200, `text/html` Content-Type, and response body containing both the unsanitized payload string `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>` and `facebook_urls`.
