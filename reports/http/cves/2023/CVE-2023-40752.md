## Vulnerability
PHPJabbers Make an Offer Widget version 1.0 is affected by a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `action` parameter of `index.php`.

Unauthenticated remote attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the browser context of any user who visits the crafted URL, enabling session-cookie theft or actions performed on behalf of the victim.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues one POST request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?controller=pjAdmin&action=%3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dprompt%28document.domain%29%3E` embedding the XSS payload directly in the query string. Detection succeeds when the HTTP 200 response body reflects the exact unsanitized payload string together with the phrase "didn't exists", the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, confirming lack of output encoding or sanitization on the error path.
