## Vulnerability
The wpForo Forum plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘wpforo_debug’ function in versions up to, and including, 2.1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a crafted link.

Impact: Unauthenticated attackers can inject malicious JavaScript through the wpforo_debug function to steal WordPress administrator session cookies when they view crafted links.

CVSS v3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

Remediation: Fixed in 2.1.9.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a crafted unauthenticated GET request to `/community/main-forum/?param=%3Cscript%3Ealert(/document.domain/)%3C/script%3E` and matches for reflection of the XSS payload in the response body (along with "wpforo" string, text/html content-type, and HTTP 200 status) to confirm the lack of sanitization.
