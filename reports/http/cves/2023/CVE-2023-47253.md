## Vulnerability
Qualitor through version 8.20 is affected by a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2023-47253, CWE-77, CVSS 9.8). The flaw exists in `/html/ad/adpesquisasql/request/processVariavel.php` where the `gridValoresPopHidden` parameter allows unauthenticated injection and execution of arbitrary PHP code. Unauthenticated attackers can run system commands, leading to full server compromise (C:H/I:H/A:H). Remediation requires upgrading to version 8.21 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to the endpoint with the payload `gridValoresPopHidden=echo%20system("ipconfig");`. It confirms successful arbitrary command execution by matching the response body for Windows-specific ipconfig output ("Windows" and "DNS" strings), text/javascript content-type header, and HTTP 200 status code.
