## Vulnerability
phpIPAM versions prior to 1.5.1 suffer from a missing authorization vulnerability (CWE-862) in the `find_full_subnets.php` endpoint. Unauthenticated attackers can retrieve a list of high-usage IP subnets, exposing sensitive details such as subnet descriptions, IP address ranges, and usage statistics. The endpoint performs no authorization checks.

CVSS 3.1 Score: 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).  
Impact: Unauthenticated access to sensitive network subnet information including descriptions, ranges, and usage rates.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/functions/scripts/find_full_subnets.php` and matches on status code 200 along with response body containing "Array", "[subnet]", and "[description]" strings to confirm the unauthorized disclosure of subnet data.
