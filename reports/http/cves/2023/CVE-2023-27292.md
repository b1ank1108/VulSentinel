## Vulnerability

OpenCATS version 0.9.6 contains an open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601) due to improper validation of user-supplied GET parameters in the `url` parameter of the settings preview page functionality. The vulnerability allows authenticated attackers to redirect users to arbitrary external websites by manipulating the URL parameter passed to the page preview feature. This can be leveraged for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or as a stepping stone for more sophisticated attacks including potential template injection. The CVSS v3.1 score is 5.4 (Medium), with the attack vector requiring network access, low attack complexity, low privileges (authenticated user), and user interaction, with a changed scope affecting confidentiality and integrity at a low level.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: state-change

The template performs a two-step detection process:

1. **Authentication**: Sends a POST request to `/index.php?m=login&a=attemptLogin` with username and password credentials to establish an authenticated session.

2. **Open Redirect Verification**: Sends a GET request to `/index.php?m=settings&a=previewPage&url=https://oast.me` to test the open redirect vulnerability by attempting to load an external URL (oast.me) in the page preview frame.

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking for:
- HTTP 200 status code
- Presence of `<TITLE>Page Preview</TITLE>` in the response
- Presence of `<FRAME src="https://oast.me">` confirming the external URL was embedded without proper validation

The template follows redirects (`host-redirects: true`) to capture the full redirect chain. Detection requires valid credentials to be supplied via template variables.
