## Vulnerability
ProfilePress WordPress plugin (properfraction/profilepress) <= 4.13.1 suffers from Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). Unaffected versions: n/a. CVSS 8.6 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L). Attackers can register a new user with `reg_select_role=editor` via the unauthenticated `pp_ajax_signup` endpoint, escalating to editor privileges and gaining access to restricted site administration features and data.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs full unauthenticated exploitation for confirmation:  
- Issues multipart POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` (`action=pp_ajax_signup`) containing randomized username/email/password/firstname/lastname and `reg_select_role=editor`; matches JSON 200 response containing "profilepress-reg-status success" and "Registration successful.".  
- Immediately POSTs the new credentials to `/wp-login.php`.  
- GETs `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=page` and confirms editor-level access via presence of "Filter pages list" and "Add Page" strings in the HTML body.
