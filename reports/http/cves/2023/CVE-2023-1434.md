## Vulnerability
Odoo versions before 16.0 suffer from CVE-2023-1434, a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS, CWE-79) vulnerability. It is caused by an incorrect `text/html` content type being set on the `/web/set_profiling` API endpoint, allowing unsanitized reflection of the `collectors` query parameter.

Impact includes arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/web/set_profiling?profile=0&collectors=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. Detection succeeds if the response body contains the injected `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` tag along with `"params":` and `session`, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
