## Vulnerability
SolarView Compact <= 6.00 is affected by a Local File Inclusion vulnerability. There is an arbitrary read file vulnerability in SolarView Compact 6.00 and below; attackers can bypass authentication to read files through texteditor.php.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure.

Upgrade to a patched version of SolarView Compact or apply the vendor-provided security patch to mitigate the LFI vulnerability.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N (score 9.1)  
CWE-ID: CWE-276

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw POST request to `/texteditor.php` with form-encoded parameters `directory=%2F/etc`, `open=%8AJ%82%AD`, `r_charset=none`, `newfile=`, and `editfile=%2Fhome%2Fcontec%2Fdata%2FoutputCtrl%2Fremote%2F2016%2F` to trigger the LFI. It matches on the response body containing the strings `action="texteditor.php"`, `adduser.conf`, and `deluser.conf` (indicating successful inclusion and leakage of configuration file references), plus `text/html` Content-Type header and HTTP 200 status.
