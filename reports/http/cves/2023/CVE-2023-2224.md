## Vulnerability
The SEO by 10Web WordPress plugin before 1.2.7 fails to sanitise and escape certain settings fields. This allows high-privilege authenticated users (admins) to perform stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by injecting malicious JavaScript into the sitemap configuration, even when the unfiltered_html capability is disabled (e.g., in multisite setups). Successful exploitation can lead to script execution in the context of other administrators viewing the affected page.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first POSTs to `/wp-login.php` with `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` to authenticate, then GETs `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wdseo_sitemap` to extract the `nonce_wdseo` value, followed by a POST to the same page (with `id_message=2`) that submits a crafted form containing the XSS payload `"><audio src=x onerror=confirm(document.domain)>` inside `wd_settings[additional_pages][page_url][]`. Detection succeeds if the third response body contains the exact unsanitized payload string, returns HTTP 200, and has `text/html` Content-Type.
