## Vulnerability
WordPress Canto plugin for WordPress versions <= 3.0.4 contains an unauthenticated remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerability via the `wp_abspath` parameter in `wp-content/plugins/canto/includes/lib/download.php`. Unauthenticated attackers can include and execute arbitrary remote PHP files if `allow_url_include` is enabled in PHP, leading to full server compromise.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8 Critical)  
CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first requests `/wp-content/plugins/canto/readme.txt`, extracts the "Stable tag" version via regex, and internally verifies `compare_versions(version, "<= 3.0.4")`. It then issues `GET /wp-content/plugins/canto/includes/lib/download.php?wp_abspath=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html` and matches `status_code == 200` plus `contains_all(body, "PD9waHAK", "V29yZFByZXNz")` (base64 of `<?php` and "WordPress") to confirm the file-inclusion flaw is present.
