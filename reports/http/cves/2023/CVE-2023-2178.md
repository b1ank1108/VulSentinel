## Vulnerability
Aajoda Testimonials WordPress plugin versions prior to 2.2.2 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting. The plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, allowing high-privilege users (such as admins) to perform XSS attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (e.g. in multisite setups).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first authenticates by submitting username and password to `/wp-login.php`. It then sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=aajoda-testimonials` containing a payload that escapes a textarea and injects `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. It verifies success by checking that the response body contains the unescaped script tag and references the aajoda testimonials settings page.
