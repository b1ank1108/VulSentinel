## Vulnerability

XWiki Platform contains an open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601) due to improper validation of the `xredirect` parameter in the login functionality. An attacker can craft malicious URLs that redirect authenticated or unauthenticated users to arbitrary external websites after interacting with the XWiki login page. This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating network-based exploitation with low complexity, no privileges required, but requiring user interaction. The vulnerability is patched in XWiki versions 14.10.4 and 15.0.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the XWiki login endpoint (`/bin/login/XWiki/XWikiLogin`) with a crafted `xredirect` parameter pointing to an external domain (`//oast.me`). The template verifies the vulnerability by checking if the HTTP response contains a `Location` header that redirects to the attacker-controlled domain. The regex matcher specifically looks for a redirect header pointing to `oast.me` (or its subdomains), confirming that the application improperly validates the redirect parameter and allows redirection to arbitrary external URLs.
