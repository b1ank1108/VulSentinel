## Vulnerability
WordPress Pie Register plugin before 3.8.2.3 contains an open redirect vulnerability. The plugin does not properly validate the redirection URL when logging in and logging out. An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious site and possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations. Authenticated attackers with low privileges can manipulate the `redirect_to` parameter during logout to redirect users to malicious sites for phishing attacks. Fixed in version 3.8.2.3.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin?piereg_logout_url=true&redirect_to=https://oast.me`, follows redirects, and matches the `Location` response header with the regex `(?m)^(?:Location\s*?:\s*?)(?:https?://|//)(?:[a-zA-Z0-9\-_\.@]*)oast\.me.*$` to confirm that the `redirect_to` parameter is unsanitized and reflected in the redirect target.
