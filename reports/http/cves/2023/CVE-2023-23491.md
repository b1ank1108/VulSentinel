## Vulnerability
Quick Event Manager WordPress plugin (fullworksplugins) versions prior to 9.7.5 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting via the `category` parameter in the `qem_ajax_calendar` AJAX action.  

Unauthenticated remote attackers can craft a malicious URL that injects arbitrary JavaScript. When a victim with an active session visits the link, the payload executes in the victim's browser context (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, score 6.1, CWE-79).  

Impact includes theft of WordPress session cookies, account takeover, and arbitrary client-side actions. Fixed in 9.7.5 and later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=qem_ajax_calendar&category=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`.  

It verifies exploitation conditions with a DSL matcher requiring all of: HTTP 200, Content-Type containing "text/html", unsanitized payload string `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` present in response body, and `qem_calendar` marker confirming the plugin handled the request. This confirms the parameter is reflected without HTML escaping or output sanitization.
