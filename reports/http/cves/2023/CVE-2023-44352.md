## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-44352 is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting Adobe ColdFusion versions 2023.5 (and earlier) and 2021.11 (and earlier). The vulnerability exists in the CFIDE administrator and wizards interfaces where URLs are not properly escaped. An unauthenticated attacker can craft malicious URLs that, when visited by a victim, execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser context. This can lead to theft of ColdFusion administrator session cookies and unauthorized access to sensitive application configurations. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating network-based exploitation requiring user interaction but no authentication.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending GET requests to multiple vulnerable endpoints in the CFIDE administrator and wizards interfaces. It tests 8 different path variations targeting two main endpoints:
- `/CFIDE/wizards/common/_authenticatewizarduser.cfm`
- `/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm`

Each request injects XSS payloads through crafted URL paths using two payload types:
1. `"><img src=a onerror=alert(document.domain)>` (HTML injection with event handler)
2. `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` (direct script injection, URL-encoded)

The template uses path traversal patterns (e.g., `/{{random_string}}"><payload>/..CFIDE/...`) to inject the XSS payload into the URL, which is then reflected in the response. Detection is confirmed when the response body contains the reflected payload (either the injected `action` attribute or script tag) AND the response indicates it's a ColdFusion HTML page (contains 'ColdFusion' string and 'text/html' content type). The template stops at the first successful match across all tested paths.
