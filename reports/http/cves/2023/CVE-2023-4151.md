## Vulnerability
The Store Locator WordPress plugin before 1.4.13 fails to sanitise and escape an invalid nonce before outputting it back in an AJAX response. This results in a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability via the `asl-nounce` parameter in the `asl_ajax_handler` action. The issue can be exploited against high-privilege users such as administrators, allowing potential unauthorized access to sensitive information (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, score 6.1, CWE-79).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET to `/` and matches `/wp-content/plugins/agile-store-locator` in the body (internal check for plugin presence). It then performs a POST to `/wp-login.php` using `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials, followed by a GET to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=asl_ajax_handler&asl-nounce=<img src onerror=alert`document.domain`>`. Detection succeeds if the exact unsanitized payload appears in the second response body, the content-type is `text/html`, and status is 200. This confirms the lack of output sanitization on the reflected nonce.
