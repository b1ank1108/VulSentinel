## Vulnerability
Aria Operations for Networks contains an authenticated deserialization vulnerability. A malicious actor with network access to VMware Aria Operations for Networks and valid 'member' role credentials may be able to perform a deserialization attack resulting in remote code execution.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first authenticates via POST `/api/auth/login` (with username/password/domain) and extracts the CSRF token from the JSON response body. It then sends a crafted POST `/api/events/push-notifications` request containing a Java deserialization gadget (generated via `generate_java_gadget("dns", "http://{{interactsh-url}}", "base64")` in the `endOffset` field). Detection confirms via out-of-band DNS interaction on interactsh and HTTP 500 status code.
