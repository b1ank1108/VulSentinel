## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-22432 is an open redirect vulnerability in web2py versions prior to 2.23.1. The vulnerability exists in the admin interface where the `send` parameter is not properly validated, allowing authenticated attackers to craft malicious URLs that redirect users to arbitrary external websites. This can be exploited for phishing attacks where victims are redirected to attacker-controlled domains that may impersonate legitimate services to steal credentials or other sensitive information. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site) with a CVSS score of 6.1, indicating medium severity with network attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required (though authentication is needed to access the admin interface), required user interaction, and changed scope affecting confidentiality and integrity.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an authenticated POST request to `/admin/default/index` with credentials and a specially crafted `send` parameter containing URL-encoded backslashes followed by a test domain (`\/\/oast.pro`). The detection verifies three conditions:

1. The response body contains an anchor tag with the malicious redirect URL (`a href="\/\/oast.pro"`)
2. The Location header contains the redirect to the external domain (`\/\/oast.pro`)
3. The HTTP status code is 303 (See Other), indicating a redirect response

The template requires valid admin credentials (passed via the `password` parameter) to access the vulnerable endpoint, confirming that authentication is necessary for exploitation.
