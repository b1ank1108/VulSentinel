## Vulnerability
Critical template injection vulnerability in the Template Handler component of JeecgBoot JimuReport up to version 1.6.0. Manipulation of the SQL parameter in the `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/queryFieldBySql` endpoint leads to Freemarker template injection, resulting in remote arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects this by issuing a POST request with a JSON body containing a Freemarker payload in the `sql` field that assigns and executes a system command (`curl` to interactsh URL). Success is confirmed via OOB interaction (HTTP/DNS callback) combined with HTTP 200 status, application/json content-type, and "success" in the response body.
