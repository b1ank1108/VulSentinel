## Vulnerability
A critical SQL injection (CWE-89) exists in Jeecg-boot 3.5.0. It affects an unknown part of the file `jmreport/qurestSql`. Manipulation of the `apiSelectId` argument allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries. CVSS 3.1 score is 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access, complete data leakage, or arbitrary data manipulation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues one POST request to `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/qurestSql` with `Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8` and a JSON body containing a crafted `apiSelectId` value that injects an `updatexml()` payload designed to trigger an XPATH syntax error leaking `current_user()` on vulnerable instances. Detection succeeds if the response body contains both the strings "SQLException" and "XPATH syntax error:", the `Content-Type` header is `application/json`, and the status code is 200. It also extracts the leaked database username via regex from the error message.
