## Vulnerability
BlogEngine CMS (blogengine.net) versions 3.3.8.0 and earlier contains an open redirect (CWE-601, CVE-2023-33405) exploitable via the `years` parameter on `/default.aspx`. Unauthenticated remote attackers can supply an arbitrary URL, causing the server to issue a `Location` header redirect to the attacker-controlled destination. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1). Impact limited to phishing facilitation by redirecting legitimate users; no server-side data modification or code execution.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/default.aspx?years=http://oast.pro` and applies a regex matcher on the response `Location` header to confirm whether the supplied value is reflected unsanitized as the redirect target.
