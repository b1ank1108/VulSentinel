## Vulnerability
An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0 through 4.2.7. An improper access check allows unauthorized access to webservice endpoints.  
**Impact:** The vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to user passwords, compromising the confidentiality of user accounts.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to Joomla! version 4.2.8 or later.  
**CVSS:** 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues unauthenticated GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true` (fallback: `/api/v1/config/application?public=true`), stopping at the first match. It verifies exploitation conditions via HTTP 200 status, JSON content-type (`application/json` or `application/vnd.api+json`), and presence of both `"links":` and `"attributes":` in the response body. This confirms the access-control bypass that exposes configuration data containing user passwords.
