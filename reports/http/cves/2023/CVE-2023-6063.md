## Vulnerability
WP Fastest Cache WordPress plugin before 1.2.2 does not properly sanitise and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement, leading to SQL injection exploitable by unauthenticated users (CWE-89).  

Unauthenticated attackers can extract the complete WordPress database including user credentials and site data. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). Fixed in 1.2.2.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first requests `/wp-content/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/readme.txt` and matches status_code == 200 AND body contains "WP Fastest Cache" (internal plugin presence check).  

If present, the flow then executes two GET requests to `/wp-login.php` (with 20 s timeout) using a `wordpress_logged_in` cookie containing the time-based blind SQLi payload `AND (SELECT 5025 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(7)))NkcI) AND "tqKU"="tqKU`. Detection triggers on duration >= 7 s AND status_code == 200 AND body contains "/wp-".
