## Vulnerability
XWiki Platform (generic wiki offering runtime services) suffers from reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the resubmit template. An attacker can craft a URL such as `/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Main?xpage=resubmit&resubmit=javascript:alert(document.domain)&xback=javascript:alert(document.domain)` to inject arbitrary JavaScript executed in the victim's browser context. Vulnerability present since 2.5-milestone-2; fixed in 14.10.5 and 15.1-rc-1.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1) • CWE-79.  
Impact: successful exploitation leads to cross-site scripting.  
Remediation: upgrade to patched releases.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a GET request (stop-at-first-match) to `{{BaseURL}}/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Main?xpage=resubmit&resubmit=javascript:alert(document.domain)&xback=javascript:alert(document.domain)` or the shorter `/bin/view/...` path. Detection succeeds when the response body simultaneously contains the literal reflected payload `action="javascript:alert(document.domain)"` AND the string `XWikiGuest`, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and status is 200 or 401.
