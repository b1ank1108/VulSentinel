## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-24367 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Temenos T24 Release 20. The vulnerability exists in the `genrequest.jsp` endpoint, specifically in the `routineName` parameter, which fails to properly sanitize user input before reflecting it in the HTTP response. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code that, when accessed by a victim, executes in the context of the victim's browser session. This allows the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or launch additional attacks. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity), requiring user interaction but no authentication to exploit.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this XSS vulnerability by sending a GET request to `/jsps/genrequest.jsp` with a malicious payload in the `routineName` parameter: `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. The detection verifies that:

1. The injected script payload `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` is reflected in the response body without proper encoding or sanitization
2. The response contains the title `<title>Processing...</title>`, confirming the request reached the vulnerable endpoint
3. The server returns a 200 OK status code

The template uses a harmless proof-of-concept payload (`alert(document.domain)`) to verify the XSS condition exists without causing actual harm. Successful detection indicates that arbitrary JavaScript can be injected and executed in victims' browsers, enabling session hijacking, credential theft, and other client-side attacks.
