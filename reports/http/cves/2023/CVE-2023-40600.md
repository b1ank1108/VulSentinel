## Vulnerability
The EWWW Image Optimizer WordPress plugin is vulnerable to unauthenticated sensitive information exposure via the debug_log function. Unauthenticated attackers can extract sensitive debug data by accessing the debug log file when debug logging is enabled. This affects all versions up to and including 7.2.0. Impact: attackers can access sensitive embedded data, potentially leading to information disclosure and further exploitation. Remediation: remove debug information and update to the latest version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/ewww/debug.log` and checks for HTTP 200 status along with the presence of both "ewww_image_optimizer" and "__construct()" strings in the response body to detect exposure of the debug log containing sensitive data.
