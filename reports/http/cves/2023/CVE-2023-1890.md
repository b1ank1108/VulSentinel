## Vulnerability

Tablesome versions prior to 1.0.9 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WordPress admin interface. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `tab` parameter in the plugin's admin pages. When a malicious URL containing crafted JavaScript is accessed by an authenticated WordPress user, the injected script executes in the context of their browser session. This allows attackers to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or launch additional attacks against the WordPress installation. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity), requiring user interaction but no privileges for exploitation.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs a two-step detection process:

1. **Authentication**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with WordPress credentials to establish an authenticated session
2. **XSS Probe**: Sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=tablesome_cpt` with a crafted payload containing `a"><script>alert\`document.domain\`</script>` in the URL parameter

The template verifies the vulnerability by checking for:
- HTTP 200 response status
- HTML content type in the response
- Reflection of the injected script tag `<script>alert\`document_domain\`</script>` in the response body
- Presence of "tablesome" string confirming the plugin context

The detection confirms that unsanitized input is reflected in the HTML output, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability without actually executing malicious actions.
