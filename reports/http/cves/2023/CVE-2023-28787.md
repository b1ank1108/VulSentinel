## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-28787 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the Quiz and Survey Master WordPress plugin (versions up to and including 8.1.4). The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands. Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries through the `question_ids_1` cookie parameter without requiring authentication. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (SQL Injection) with a CVSS score of 8.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N), indicating network-exploitable, low complexity, no privileges required, and high confidentiality impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this SQL injection vulnerability by sending a time-based blind SQL injection payload via the `question_ids_1` cookie parameter. The payload `1) AND SLEEP(8)-- -` attempts to trigger an 8-second delay in the database response. The template verifies the vulnerability by checking three conditions:
1. The HTTP response takes 8 seconds or longer to complete (indicating successful SQL execution)
2. The server returns a 200 status code
3. The response body contains indicators of the Quiz and Survey Master plugin (`quiz-master-next` and `qsm_`)

This time-based detection method confirms the presence of exploitable SQL injection without modifying data or extracting sensitive information during the scan.
