## Vulnerability
WordPress GN Publisher plugin before 1.5.6 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via the `tab` parameter in `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=gn-publisher-settings` due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the context of an authenticated admin session, enabling theft of cookie-based credentials and other attacks. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Fixed in 1.5.6.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first authenticates via POST to `/wp-login.php` using `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials, then sends GET to the settings page with `tab=%22%2F+onmouseover%3Dalert%28document.domain%29%3B%2F%2F`. It verifies exploitation by confirming HTTP 200, `text/html` Content-Type, unsanitized payload reflection in the body, and presence of "GN Publisher" string.
