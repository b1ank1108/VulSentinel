## Vulnerability
phpMyFAQ v3.1.11 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the send2friend functionality. The `artlang` GET parameter is not sanitized, allowing arbitrary JavaScript injection.  
Unauthenticated attackers can craft malicious URLs that, when visited by a victim, execute JS in the victim's browser context (e.g., session-cookie theft).  
Impact: client-side code execution leading to data exfiltration.  
Remediation: upgrade to 3.1.12.  
CVSS v3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/?action=send2friend&artlang=aaaa%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`, then matches on HTTP 200 status, presence of the string "phpmyfaq" in body, unsanitized reflection of `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`, and HTML content-type to confirm the reflection point.
