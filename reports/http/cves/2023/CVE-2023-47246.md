## Vulnerability
SysAid Server (On-Premise) versions before 23.3.36 contain a path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in the userentry endpoint. An unauthenticated remote attacker can traverse to `/tomcat/webapps/` and write arbitrary files to the webroot, resulting in remote code execution. The flaw was exploited in the wild in November 2023 and added to the CISA KEV catalog. CVSSv3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Impact includes full server compromise. Remediation requires applying vendor patches from 23.3.36 onward.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template actively exploits the flaw for detection. It sends a POST to `/userentry?accountId=/../../../tomcat/webapps/{{rand_base(5)}}/&symbolName=test&base64UserName=YWRtaW4=` containing a hex-decoded deflate payload that writes a test file to the webroot, followed by a 15-second GET to `/{{directory}}/CVE-2023-47246.txt`. Success is confirmed by HTTP 200 on both requests and `contains(body_2,'CVE_TEST')`.
