## Vulnerability
Online Security Guards Hiring System 1.0 (PHPGurukul) contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) in `search-request.php`. The `searchdata` parameter is unsanitized and reflected directly into the HTML response. Unauthenticated remote attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript (e.g., via `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`) that executes in the context of any user who views the crafted search result. Impact includes session-cookie theft and client-side attacks. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single POST request to `/search-request.php` with form-urlencoded body `searchdata=<img%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain)>&search=`. Detection succeeds when all of the following match: HTTP 200, Content-Type contains "text/html", the exact unsanitized payload appears verbatim in the response body, and the page title contains "Online Security Gauard Hiring System |Search Request". This confirms the reflected XSS flaw where attacker input reaches the browser without escaping.
