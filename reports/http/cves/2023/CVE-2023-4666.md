## Vulnerability
The Form-Maker WordPress plugin does not validate signatures when creating them on the server from user input, allowing unauthenticated users to create arbitrary files and lead to RCE. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit missing signature validation to upload arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution on WordPress installations running vulnerable Form-Maker plugins. Remediation: Fixed in 1.15.20. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score: 9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/form-maker/readme.txt` and applies an AND matcher condition requiring status_code == 200, body containing "Form Maker by 10Web", and compare_versions(version, '< 1.15.20') where version is extracted via regex "Stable tag: ([0-9.]+)" from the body.
