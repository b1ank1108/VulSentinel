## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-35078 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core. The vulnerability affects versions through 11.10 and allows remote unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication controls entirely. This flaw enables attackers to access sensitive APIs without any credentials, leading to unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII), the ability to add administrative accounts, and modify system configuration. The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild in July 2023, prompting CISA alerts and emergency patches from Ivanti.

The root cause is an authentication bypass (CWE-287) in the API layer, specifically affecting the Azure Active Directory integration endpoints. The CVSS score of 9.8 reflects the severity: network-accessible, low complexity, requiring no privileges or user interaction, with high impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The EPSS score of 0.94468 (99.996th percentile) indicates an extremely high probability of exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by attempting to access a privileged API endpoint that should require authentication. It sends an unauthenticated GET request to `/mifs/aad/api/v2/admins/users`, which is part of the Azure Active Directory integration API and should only be accessible to authenticated administrators.

The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for:
1. Response body containing user enumeration data fields: 'results', 'userId', and 'name'
2. Content-Type header indicating JSON response ('application/json')
3. HTTP 200 status code indicating successful access

If all three conditions are met, the vulnerability is confirmed - the template successfully accessed administrative user information without providing any authentication credentials, demonstrating the authentication bypass.
