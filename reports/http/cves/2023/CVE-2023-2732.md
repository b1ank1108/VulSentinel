## Vulnerability

The MStore API plugin for WordPress versions up to and including 3.9.2 contains an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2023-2732). The flaw stems from insufficient verification of the user being supplied during the add listing REST API request through the plugin. This allows unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, including administrators, if they have access to the user ID. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) with a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical). The EPSS score of 0.89995 (99.569th percentile) indicates a very high probability of exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a two-step detection process:

1. **Authentication Bypass Trigger**: Sends a GET request to `/wp-json/wp/v2/add-listing?id=1` without any authentication credentials. This endpoint in vulnerable versions improperly authenticates the user based on the supplied ID parameter.

2. **Verification**: Follows up with a GET request to `/wp-admin/profile.php` to verify successful authentication. The template checks for the presence of 'email-description' and 'Username' strings in the response body, which indicate access to the WordPress admin profile page that should only be accessible to authenticated users.

The detection confirms the vulnerability by demonstrating that an unauthenticated request can establish an authenticated session as user ID 1 (typically the administrator account).
