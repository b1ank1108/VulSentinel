## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-0669 is a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in Fortra GoAnywhere MFT. The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of attacker-controlled objects in the License Response Servlet, specifically a command injection flaw that can be exploited without authentication. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) with a CVSS score of 7.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). The EPSS score of 0.94378 (99.965th percentile) indicates extremely high exploitation probability in the wild. This vulnerability is listed in the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

The attack vector is network-based with low complexity, requiring no user interaction. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system, potentially leading to complete system compromise with high impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goanywhere/lic/accept` endpoint. The payload exploits the unsafe deserialization vulnerability by:

1. Generating a Java deserialization gadget using `generate_java_gadget()` configured for DNS callback
2. Encrypting the gadget with AES-CBC using hardcoded keys
3. Base64 encoding and URL encoding the encrypted payload
4. Submitting it as the `bundle` parameter to the License Response Servlet

The template verifies successful exploitation through three conditions:
- Receipt of a DNS callback to the Interactsh server (confirming code execution)
- Presence of "GoAnywhere" string in the response body (confirming target identification)
- HTTP 500 status code (indicating the deserialization attempt was processed)

This detection method confirms the presence of the RCE vulnerability through out-of-band DNS interaction, demonstrating that arbitrary code execution is achievable.
