## Vulnerability
Unauthenticated file read (LFI) in the Portal component of Oracle PeopleSoft Enterprise PeopleTools.  
Easily exploitable via network access over HTTP through the `wsrp-url` parameter, allowing arbitrary local file reads (including configuration files and sensitive data).  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5).  
Supported affected versions: 8.59 and 8.60.  
Impact: complete unauthorized access to critical data or all accessible PeopleSoft data.  
Remediation: upgrade to a version newer than 8.60 with proper validation/restriction of `file://` URLs in the `wsrp-url` parameter.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the flaw by issuing two unauthenticated GET requests (stopping at first match) to `{{BaseURL}}/RP?wsrp-url=file:///etc/passwd` (Unix target) and `{{BaseURL}}/RP?wsrp-url=file:///c:\windows\win.ini` (Windows target). Success is confirmed by a 200 status, `content/unknown` Content-Type header, and regex matches for `root:.*:0:0:` (Unix) or `bit app support` (Windows) in the response body.
