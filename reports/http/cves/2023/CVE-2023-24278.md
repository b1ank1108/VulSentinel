## Vulnerability
Squidex CMS before version 7.4.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the `/squid.svg` endpoint. Query parameters such as `background`, `title`, and `text` are reflected unsanitized into the generated SVG output. An attacker can craft a malicious link that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context (same origin), enabling session hijacking, defacement, theft of sensitive information, or unauthorized administrative operations.

CVSS: 6.1 (Medium)  
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/squid.svg?title=Not%20Found&text=This%20is%20not%20the%20page%20you%20are%20looking%20for!&background=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E%3Cimg%20src=%22&small`. Detection succeeds when the response body simultaneously contains the injected `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` payload and the string "looking for!", the `Content-Type` header is `image/svg+xml`, and the status is 200. This verifies unsanitized reflection of attacker-controlled input, confirming the reflected XSS condition.
