## Vulnerability
L-Soft LISTSERV 16.5 before 17 suffers from a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. The REPORT parameter (after `z` but before `a`) in `wa.exe` fails to sanitize input and allows arbitrary JavaScript injection via a crafted URL.

- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)
- CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
- Impact: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access or data theft.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wa.exe?REPORT&z=4&"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>a=1` and verifies the injected payload `><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` is reflected unsanitized in the response body alongside the string `LISTSERV`, with `text/html` content-type and HTTP 200 status.
