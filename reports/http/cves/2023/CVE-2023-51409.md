## Vulnerability
Jordy Meow AI Engine (ChatGPT Chatbot) for WordPress is vulnerable to Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CVE-2023-51409, CWE-434). Unauthenticated attackers can upload PHP files via the `mwai-ui/v1/files/upload` REST endpoint, leading to potential remote code execution and full system compromise on the WordPress installation.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8 Critical). Remediation requires updating to 1.9.99+.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a POST multipart/form-data request to `/wp-json/mwai-ui/v1/files/upload` with a randomly generated `{{filename}}.php` file containing benign text content. It verifies exploitation conditions by checking for HTTP 200, JSON content-type, and response body containing `"success":true` along with the uploaded filename.
