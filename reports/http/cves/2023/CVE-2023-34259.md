## Vulnerability
Kyocera TASKalfa printer suffers from a path traversal vulnerability in its CCRX component (CVE-2023-34259, CWE-22). Unauthenticated attackers can manipulate file path values to access sensitive file system resources including source code and critical system configuration files.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single GET request with a heavily URL-encoded path traversal payload (`/wlmdeu%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc/passwd%00index.htm`) and verifies success via three matchers: regex `root:.*:0:0` present in response body, `KM-MFP` present in Server header, and HTTP 200 status.
