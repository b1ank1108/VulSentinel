## Vulnerability

Purchase Order Management v1.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the password parameter at `/classes/Login.php`. The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the password field during login attempts, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser context. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). Successful exploitation could enable attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in victims' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, website defacement, or theft of sensitive information. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) as the victim must be tricked into clicking a malicious link containing the XSS payload.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a POST request to `/classes/Login.php?f=login` with a crafted XSS payload in the password parameter. The payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>` is URL-encoded and submitted alongside a random username. The template verifies the vulnerability by checking for three conditions: (1) the response body contains the unescaped XSS payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`, (2) the response body contains the word "incorrect" (indicating the login failed but the payload was reflected), and (3) the response has a 200 status code with `text/html` content type. The presence of the unescaped payload in the response confirms that user input is reflected without proper sanitization, making the application vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.
