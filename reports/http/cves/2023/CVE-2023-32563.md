## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-32563 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Ivanti Avalanche. An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution through the RemoteControl server without requiring authentication. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Path Traversal), with a CVSS score of 9.8. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload malicious files to arbitrary locations on the server by exploiting path traversal in the `/Servlet/Skins` endpoint, leading to remote code execution when the uploaded file is accessed.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template exploits the vulnerability through a two-step process:

1. **File Upload with Path Traversal**: Sends a POST request to `/Servlet/Skins` with a multipart form containing:
   - A `guid` parameter set to `../../../Web/webapps/ROOT` (path traversal to the web root)
   - A file upload with a randomly named JSP file containing code that outputs "CVE-2023-32563"

2. **Verification**: Sends a GET request to the uploaded JSP file at the web root to verify successful code execution by checking for the output string "CVE-2023-32563" in the response body.

The template confirms the vulnerability by successfully uploading and executing a JSP file through path traversal, demonstrating arbitrary code execution capability.
