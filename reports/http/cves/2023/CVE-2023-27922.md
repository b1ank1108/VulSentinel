## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-27922 is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Newsletter WordPress plugin affecting versions prior to 7.6.9. The vulnerability exists because the plugin fails to properly escape generated URLs before outputting them in HTML attributes. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code through URL parameters that gets reflected back to users without sanitization.

The vulnerability is particularly dangerous when exploited against high-privilege users such as WordPress administrators. Successful exploitation could allow authenticated attackers to steal admin session cookies and potentially hijack WordPress sites running the vulnerable Newsletter plugin. The flaw is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity), indicating network-based attack vector with low attack complexity but requiring user interaction.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: state-change

The Nuclei template performs a two-step authenticated detection process:

1. **Authentication**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with WordPress credentials to establish an authenticated session
2. **XSS Probe**: Sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=newsletter_system_status` with a malicious payload in the URL parameter: `a"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`

The template verifies the vulnerability by checking that:
- The response returns HTTP 200 status
- The content-type is text/html
- The response contains Newsletter plugin indicators (`_newsletter_`)
- The injected XSS payload `"><script>alert(document_domain)</script>` is reflected unescaped in the response body

This confirms that the plugin fails to sanitize URL parameters before rendering them in HTML attributes, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of authenticated administrator sessions.
