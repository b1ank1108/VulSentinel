## Vulnerability

The Better Search Replace WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection (CWE-502) in all versions up to and including 1.4.4 via deserialization of untrusted input. Unauthenticated attackers can inject PHP objects. No gadget chain (POP) exists within the plugin itself. However, if a suitable POP chain is available from another installed plugin or theme, this could lead to arbitrary code execution, file deletion, or sensitive data retrieval.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8). Remediation: update to version 1.4.5 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/better-search-replace/README.txt` or `readme.txt` (stop-at-first-match). It verifies status_code == 200, contains(body, 'Better Search'), extracts version via regex `Stable tag: ([0-9.]+)`, and applies DSL `compare_versions(version, '< 1.4.5')`.
