## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-23492 is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the Login with Phone Number WordPress plugin versions prior to 1.4.2. The vulnerability exists in the `login-with-phonenumber.php` file within the `lwp_forgot_password()` function. The flaw allows attackers to inject malicious scripts through unsanitized input parameters in the AJAX endpoint `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` when the action parameter is set to `lwp_forgot_password`. 

Successful exploitation enables attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the context of victim browsers, potentially leading to theft of sensitive user information (including session cookies), unauthorized actions performed on behalf of victims, or further attacks against application users. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8, indicating high severity, and an EPSS score of 0.86218 (99.387th percentile), suggesting active exploitation likelihood.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the WordPress AJAX endpoint `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action parameter set to `lwp_forgot_password` and an ID parameter containing an XSS payload: `<svg onload=alert(document.domain)>`. 

The template verifies the vulnerability through three conditions:
1. The response body contains the reflected XSS payload `<svg onload=alert(document.domain)>` without proper sanitization
2. The response body contains the text `message":"Update password`, confirming the forgot password functionality is processing the request
3. The response has a `text/html` content type header
4. The HTTP status code is 200

The presence of the unescaped SVG payload in the HTML response confirms that user input is reflected without proper sanitization, making the application vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.
