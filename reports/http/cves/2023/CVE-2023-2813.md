## Vulnerability
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2023-2813) in the search box (`?s=`) parameter of 25+ WordPress themes. Input is reflected unsanitized, enabling an unauthenticated remote attacker to craft a malicious link that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context upon click (session hijacking, defacement, sensitive data theft possible).  
CVSS: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/?s={{rand_base(6)}}<IMG """><IMG SRC=/ onerror="alert(document.domain)"></img>/{{rand_base(3)}}/` and verifies reflection by matching both the exact unsanitized payload string and `wp-content/theme` (to confirm theme context) in a 200 OK response.
