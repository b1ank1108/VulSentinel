## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-3578 is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in DedeCMS version 5.7.109. The vulnerability exists in the `co_do.php` file where the `rssurl` parameter can be manipulated to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests to attacker-controlled destinations. This is classified as CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) with a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical). The vulnerability requires no authentication and can be exploited remotely over the network with low attack complexity. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive data exposure, unauthorized access to internal resources, and potential server compromise.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-stage detection process:

1. **Fingerprinting Stage**: Sends a GET request to the root path (`/`) to verify the target is running DedeCMS by checking for the presence of "DedeCms" string in the response.

2. **SSRF Verification Stage**: Sends a GET request to `/co_do.php` with the `rssurl` parameter set to an Interactsh URL (`/co_do.php?rssurl=https://{{interactsh-url}}`). The template then monitors for DNS or HTTP callbacks to the Interactsh server, confirming that the vulnerable server made an outbound request to the attacker-controlled URL. This demonstrates the SSRF vulnerability by proving the server can be forced to make arbitrary external requests.

The detection relies on out-of-band interaction (OAST) to confirm the vulnerability without causing destructive actions.
