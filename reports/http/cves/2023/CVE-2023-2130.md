## Vulnerability
SourceCodester Purchase Order Management System 1.0 contains a critical SQL injection (CWE-89) vulnerability in `/admin/suppliers/view_details.php` via unsanitized manipulation of the `id` GET parameter. The issue allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, resulting in potential unauthorized access, full data leakage, and data manipulation (CVSS 3.1: 9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/admin/suppliers/view_details.php` injecting a time-based blind SQLi payload (`id=1'+AND+(SELECT+9687+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(6)))pnac)+AND+'ARHJ'='ARHJ`) and confirms vulnerability if the response duration is >=6 seconds, status is 200, content-type includes text/html, and body contains "Supplier Name".
