## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-34020 is an open redirection vulnerability in the WordPress Uncanny Toolkit for LearnDash plugin affecting versions prior to 3.6.4.4. The vulnerability exists in the plugin's REST API endpoint `/ult/v2/review-banner-visibility` which fails to properly validate the `redirect_url` parameter when the `redirect=yes` parameter is set. This allows unauthenticated attackers to craft malicious URLs that redirect LearnDash users to arbitrary external domains, including phishing sites designed to steal login credentials and compromise user accounts. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 4.7 (Medium severity), requiring user interaction but no authentication to exploit.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the vulnerable REST API endpoint `/?rest_route=/ult/v2/review-banner-visibility` with parameters `action=maybe-later`, `redirect=yes`, and `redirect_url=https://interact.sh`. The template verifies the vulnerability by checking if the HTTP response contains a `Location` header that redirects to the attacker-controlled interact.sh domain. The regex matcher confirms that the server performs an unvalidated redirect to the external URL specified in the `redirect_url` parameter, demonstrating the open redirect condition. While the underlying vulnerability enables phishing attacks (a form of social engineering leading to credential theft), the template itself only verifies the redirect behavior through an external callback mechanism.
