## Vulnerability
Mlflow prior to version 2.9.2 suffers from a path traversal vulnerability (CWE-29) when handling `artifact_location` and `source` parameters in the MLflow Tracking API. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive data like SSH private keys or configuration files.

CVSS 3.1 score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The nuclei template verifies the flaw through a multi-step interaction:
- POST to create an experiment with traversal payload in artifact_location pointing to /etc/
- Create a run and registered model
- Create model version sourcing from file:///etc/
- GET /model-versions/get-artifact to retrieve `passwd` file

Matchers confirm success by detecting root user line from /etc/passwd in body and proper octet-stream download headers for "passwd" file.

This is intrusive as it performs actual file reads.
