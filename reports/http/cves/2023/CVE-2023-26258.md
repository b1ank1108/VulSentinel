## Vulnerability
Arcserve UDP through 9.0.6034 suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability. The SOAP method `getVersionInfo` exposed at `/WebServiceImpl/services/FlashServiceImpl` leaks the `AuthUUID` token. This token can be submitted to `/WebServiceImpl/services/VirtualStandbyServiceImpl` via `validateUserByUUID` to acquire a valid administrative session, enabling execution of any task as administrator. Impact includes full compromise of backup data and system control (CVSS 9.8, CWE-863).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first issues a SOAP POST to `/WebServiceImpl/services/FlashServiceImpl` calling `getVersionInfo` to extract the `ns5:authUUID` value from the XML response. It then performs a `validateUserByUUID` request to `/WebServiceImpl/services/VirtualStandbyServiceImpl` using the token, followed by `getLocalHostAsTrust` on `FlashServiceImpl`. Detection succeeds if responses are HTTP 200 with `text/xml` content-type and the final body contains `ns5:uuid`, `ns5:userName` and `ns5:password` elements confirming successful session hijack and credential extraction.
