## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-1362 is a clickjacking vulnerability affecting the bumsys application (GitHub repository unilogies/bumsys) prior to version 2.0.2. The vulnerability stems from improper restriction of rendered UI layers or frames, classified as CWE-1021. The application fails to implement proper clickjacking prevention headers (specifically X-Frame-Options), allowing the application to be embedded in frames on malicious websites. This enables attackers to overlay transparent or opaque layers over the legitimate application interface, tricking users into performing unintended actions while believing they are interacting with a trusted interface. The CVSS v3.1 score is 6.1 (Medium severity) with vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation requiring user interaction with potential for low confidentiality and integrity impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: detect-only

The template performs a detection check by sending a GET request to the base URL of the target application. It verifies the presence of the vulnerability through three conditions:
1. The response returns HTTP status code 200
2. The X-Frame-Options header is absent from the HTTP response headers
3. The response body contains the string 'BUM</b>Sys</a>', confirming the application is bumsys

All three conditions must be satisfied for the vulnerability to be confirmed. The template does not attempt to exploit the clickjacking vulnerability but only identifies whether the application lacks the necessary security headers that would prevent frame-based attacks.
