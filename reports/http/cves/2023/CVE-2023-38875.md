## Vulnerability
PHP Login System 2.0.1 (msaad1999) contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw (CWE-79) caused by unsanitized input in the `validator` (and `selector`) parameter of the `/reset-password` endpoint. Remote attackers can craft a malicious URL that, when visited by an authenticated or unauthenticated user, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser under the application's origin. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Impact includes potential theft of cookies or session tokens.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/reset-password/?selector=test"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>&validator=test` and confirms the vulnerability if the response body contains the unsanitized payload string, the application signature "Embeddable PHP Login System", `text/html` content-type, and HTTP 200 status.
