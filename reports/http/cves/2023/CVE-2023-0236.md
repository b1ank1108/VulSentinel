## Vulnerability
WordPress Tutor LMS plugin before 2.0.10 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape the reset_key and user_id parameters before outputting them back in attributes. An attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, which can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. This vulnerability can be used against high-privilege users such as admin.

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the affected website. Fixed in version 2.0.10.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)  
CWE-79

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first authenticates via POST /wp-login.php using supplied username/password credentials, then sends GET /dashboard/retrieve-password/?reset_key=%22%3E%3Csvg%20onload=prompt(document.domain)%3E&user_id=dd. Success is confirmed when status_code is 200 and body_2 simultaneously contains the unsanitized payload string "<svg onload=prompt(document.domain)>" plus "Instructor Registration".
