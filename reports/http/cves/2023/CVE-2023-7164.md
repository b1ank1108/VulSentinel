## Vulnerability
BackWPup WordPress plugin < 4.0.4 exposes a directory listing in its temporary backup folder (`wp-content/uploads/backwpup-[hash]-(backups|temp)`) due to missing access controls. Unauthenticated remote attackers can enumerate and download full site backups (`.tar.gz`, `.tar`, `.zip`, `.sql` files), enabling complete database and file exfiltration.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues sequential unauthenticated GET requests:  
1. Probes standard WordPress `wp-content/uploads/` paths (including `/blog/`, `/wordpress/`, `/wp/` variants) and matches `status_code == 200`, `Index of` in body, and `backwpup-[a-f0-9]{6}-(backups|temp)` regex to locate the exposed folder.  
2. Requests the discovered folder and verifies presence of backup archives via regex on filenames and `status == 200`.  
All steps are non-destructive fingerprinting only.
