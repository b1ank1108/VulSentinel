## Vulnerability
The Hotel Booking Lite WordPress plugin before 4.8.5 does not validate file paths provided via user input and lacks proper CSRF and authorisation checks. This allows unauthenticated users to download and delete arbitrary files on the server.

Impact: unauthenticated attackers can read and remove any file on WordPress servers running the plugin (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, score 9.8; CWE-22). Fixed in 4.8.5.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/?filename=../../../../../../etc/passwd&mphb_action=download`. It verifies the arbitrary file download (path-traversal LFI) by matching:
- regex `root:.*:0:0:` in response body
- response headers containing both `filename=` and `/etc/passwd`
- HTTP status 200
