## Vulnerability
Citrix NetScaler ADC & Gateway is affected by an unauthenticated out-of-bounds memory read (CVE-2023-6549, CWE-125) in the web interface. Remote attackers can recover potentially sensitive memory contents (including observed POST request bodies) from appliances configured as Gateway or AAA virtual server via the commonly exposed /nf/auth/startwebview.do endpoint. Similar to Citrix Bleed (CVE-2023-4966) but less likely to return highly sensitive data.

CVSS v3.1: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Remediation: Update to version 13.1-51.15 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unsafe raw GET request to `/nf/auth/startwebview.do` with an excessively long Host header (repeated 'A' characters, truncated in YAML but designed to exceed buffer limits and trigger the OOB read). It verifies the condition via HTTP 200 status and presence of both "/nf/auth/webview/done" and "AuthenticationRequirements" strings in the response body.
