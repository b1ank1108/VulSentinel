## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-0514 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Membership Database WordPress plugin version 1.0 and earlier. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `tab` parameter (and related parameters in the admin interface). An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the browser of authenticated users who access specially crafted URLs or submit malicious requests. This allows the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or launch additional attacks within the context of the affected site.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). The attack vector is network-based with low attack complexity, requires no privileges but does require user interaction, and has a changed scope with low confidentiality and integrity impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability through a two-step authenticated process:

1. **Authentication**: The template first authenticates to the WordPress admin panel by sending a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with valid credentials (`username` and `password` parameters).

2. **XSS Injection**: After successful authentication, it sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=member-database%2Flist_members.php` with a crafted payload in the `value` parameter: `asd"</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>//`. This payload attempts to break out of the existing context and inject a JavaScript alert.

3. **Verification**: The template confirms the vulnerability by checking that:
   - The response returns HTTP 200 status
   - The content type is `text/html`
   - The injected script `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` appears unescaped in the response body
   - The response contains "Member Database" text, confirming the correct page context

The template demonstrates that user-supplied input is reflected in the HTML response without proper sanitization, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution.
