## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-34754 is a SQL injection vulnerability in bloofox v0.5.2.1. The vulnerability exists in the `pid` parameter at the endpoint `admin/index.php?mode=settings&page=plugins&action=edit`. This flaw allows attackers with administrative access to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (SQL Injection) with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating critical severity. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or complete database compromise.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs a time-based blind SQL injection test to detect this vulnerability. The detection process involves two steps:

1. **Authentication**: The template first authenticates to the admin panel by sending a POST request to `/admin/index.php` with username and password credentials.

2. **SQL Injection Probe**: After successful authentication, it sends a POST request to `/admin/index.php?mode=settings&page=plugins&action=edit` with a crafted payload in the `pid` parameter: `14'+AND+(SELECT+7401+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(6)))hwrS)--+Ptkr`. This payload attempts to trigger a 6-second delay using MySQL's SLEEP function.

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking:
- Response time is 6 seconds or greater (indicating successful SQL injection)
- Response body contains "Active</option>" and "Inactive</option>" (confirming the plugins settings page)
- HTTP status code is 200
