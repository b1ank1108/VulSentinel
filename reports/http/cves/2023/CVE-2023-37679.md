## Vulnerability
Mirth Connect, by NextGen HealthCare, is an open source data integration platform widely used by healthcare companies. Versions prior to 4.4.1 are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit XML deserialization flaws to execute arbitrary code on the Mirth Connect server, potentially compromising sensitive healthcare data and integration workflows.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first sends a GET request to `/api/server/version` (with `X-Requested-With: OpenAPI`) to retrieve and internally extract the version string. It then issues a POST request to `/api/users` (same header, `Content-Type: application/xml`) containing a malicious `<sorted-set>` payload with a `<dynamic-proxy>` and `java.beans.EventHandler` that instantiates a `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` to run `curl http://{{interactsh-url}}/`. Detection succeeds when `compare_versions(version, "<4.4.1")` is true, a DNS interaction is received from the OOB callback, and the status codes are 200 (first request) and 500 (second request).
