## Vulnerability
The System Dashboard WordPress plugin before 2.8.10 does not sanitize and escape some parameters. This enables Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via header injection in the X-Forwarded-For header for administrators in multisite WordPress configurations.

CVSS: 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N) | CWE-79

**Impact:** Authenticated admins can inject malicious JS to execute attacks against other WordPress users.

**Remediation:** Update to 2.8.10 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template authenticates as an administrator by submitting credentials to `/wp-login.php`, then issues a GET request to `/wp-admin/index.php?page=system-dashboard` injecting `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the X-Forwarded-For header. It detects successful reflection if the body contains both the payload and "Your IP</strong>", along with text/html content-type and 200 status.
