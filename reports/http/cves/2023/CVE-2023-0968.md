## Vulnerability
WordPress Watu Quiz plugin before 3.3.9.1 does not sanitize or escape parameters (email, dn, date, points) before output in the takings view (`views/takings.php`). This results in reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of any authenticated user (including high-privilege admins) who visits a crafted URL. Attackers can steal session cookies or launch additional client-side attacks. CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Fixed in 3.3.9.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first posts credentials to `/wp-login.php` to establish an authenticated session, then issues a GET to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=watu_takings&exam_id=1&dn="%2Fonmouseover%3Dalert(document.domain)%2F%2F` embedding a harmless XSS payload. Detection succeeds if the response is HTTP 200, Content-Type contains `text/html`, the exact payload string appears unescaped in the body, and the page contains the string "Watu Quizzes" (confirming the plugin view is loaded).
