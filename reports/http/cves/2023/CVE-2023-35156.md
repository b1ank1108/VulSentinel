## Vulnerability
XWiki Platform is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) since version 6.0-rc-1. Attackers can craft a URL targeting the FlamingoThemes/Cerulean delete template with a malicious `xredirect` parameter (e.g., `javascript:alert(document.domain)`) to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. 

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1 - Medium). Impact includes potential session hijacking, data theft, or phishing within the XWiki context.

Patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/xwiki/bin/get/FlamingoThemes/Cerulean?xpage=xpart&vm=delete.vm&xredirect=javascript:alert(document.domain)` (and variant path `/bin/get/...`) to trigger the reflection. It verifies success by checking for the unsanitized payload reflected in the response body as part of a `cancel` link href attribute (`cancel" href="javascript:alert(document.domain)`), along with text/html content-type and status 200 or 401.
