## Vulnerability

The Woo Bulk Price Update WordPress plugin versions prior to 2.2.2 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the 'page' parameter of the techno_get_products AJAX action. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 and can only be exploited by authenticated users with valid WordPress credentials. The flaw allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript code through the vulnerable parameter, which is reflected in the response without proper sanitization or encoding.

The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.4 (Medium severity) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation with low attack complexity, requiring low privileges and user interaction, with changed scope and low impact to confidentiality and integrity.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs a two-step detection process:

1. **Authentication**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with username and password credentials to establish an authenticated WordPress session.

2. **XSS Probe**: Sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable action parameter and an XSS payload: `?action=techno_get_products&page=<svg%20onload=alert(document.domain)>`

The template verifies the vulnerability by checking for:
- HTTP 200 status code on the second request
- Content-Type header containing "text/html"
- The injected SVG payload `<svg onload=alert(document.domain)>` reflected unencoded in the response body
- The presence of `"pagination":` in the response, confirming the AJAX action executed successfully

This detection method confirms the XSS vulnerability exists by demonstrating that malicious JavaScript is reflected without sanitization in the application's response.
