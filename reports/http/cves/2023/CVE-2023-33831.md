## Vulnerability
FUXA 1.1.13 contains an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability in the `/api/runscript` endpoint. A crafted POST request with a malicious `code` field in the JSON body allows execution of arbitrary Node.js code (via `child_process.exec`) without any authentication, credentials, or additional configuration. This grants full system compromise on the SCADA/HMI server, including access to industrial control data. CVSS 3.1 score: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). CWE-77 (Command Injection). CPE: `cpe:2.3:a:frangoteam:fuxa:1.1.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*`.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a raw POST to `/api/runscript` containing a JSON payload where the `script.code` field is set to `require('child_process').exec('id > ./_images/{{rand_base(6)}}')`. It verifies success by matching the string "Script OK:" in the POST response body and then issues a GET to the written file path, confirming the presence of "uid", "gid", and "groups" strings (AND condition) with HTTP 200 status on both requests.
