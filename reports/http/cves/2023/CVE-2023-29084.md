## Vulnerability

Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus through version 7180 contains a command injection vulnerability in its proxy settings functionality (saveServerSettings API). Authenticated users can inject OS commands via the PASSWORD parameter when configuring proxy settings (ENABLE_PROXY=true), resulting in remote code execution.

CVSS v3.1 score: 7.2 (High) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (CWE-77).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the vulnerability by simulating an authenticated exploitation: logs into the application using provided credentials (POST /j_security_check), accesses /home.do to obtain the admpcsrf token, then sends a crafted POST to /api/json/admin/saveServerSettings injecting `\r\nnslookup.exe {{interactsh-url}}` into the proxy PASSWORD field. Success is confirmed if the response body contains `{"message":"` and `Proxy Settings` together with a DNS interaction on interactsh.
