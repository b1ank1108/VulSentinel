## Vulnerability
The Stock Ticker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in the ajax_stockticker_load function in versions <= 3.23.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `class` parameter. Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts that execute if a user clicks a malicious link.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template issues a POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a crafted `class` parameter containing `onmousemove=alert(document.domain)` payload and checks for unsanitized reflection of the payload in the HTML response body.
