## Vulnerability
Prestashop posstaticfooter module <= 1.0.0 is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL injection via `posstaticfooter::getPosCurrentHook()`. Arbitrary SQL commands can be executed against the backend PrestaShop database, allowing extraction of customer data, orders, payment information, and administrative credentials (CVSS 9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template first issues an internal GET / probe to confirm a PrestaShop installation (body contains "prestashop"). It then sends a POST to `/modules/posstaticfooter/ajax.php` containing the stacked time-based blind SQLi payload `module_id=1";select(0x73656C65637420736C6565702836293B)INTO@a;prepare`b`from@a;execute`b`;--` and matches on response duration >= 6s, status_code == 200, and body containing '"[]"' to verify the injection point.
