## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-1408 is a SQL injection vulnerability in the Video List Manager WordPress plugin version 1.7 and earlier. The vulnerability exists due to improper sanitization and escaping of the `videoID` parameter before its use in SQL statements within the plugin's admin interface. This flaw allows authenticated high-privilege users (administrators) to inject malicious SQL commands into database queries.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (SQL Injection) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.2 (High severity). The attack vector is network-based with low attack complexity, but requires high privileges (PR:H) and no user interaction. Successful exploitation can lead to high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the database.

Attackers with admin-level access can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive database contents including user credentials, video metadata, and other WordPress database information. The SQL injection could also potentially be leveraged to modify or delete database records, compromising the entire WordPress installation.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs a time-based blind SQL injection detection test. It executes a two-step process:

1. **Authentication**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with admin credentials to establish an authenticated session
2. **SQL Injection Probe**: Sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tnt_video_edit_page&videoID=SLEEP(7)` with a 15-second timeout

The template verifies the vulnerability by checking three conditions:
- Response time for the second request is 7 seconds or greater (indicating the SLEEP(7) SQL command executed)
- HTTP status code 200 is returned
- Response body contains both "Edit Video" and "Youtube</option>" strings, confirming the admin page loaded

This time-based approach confirms the SQL injection vulnerability without extracting actual data, demonstrating that arbitrary SQL commands can be executed through the unsanitized `videoID` parameter.
