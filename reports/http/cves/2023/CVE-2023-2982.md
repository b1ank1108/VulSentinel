preconditions: knowledge of the target user's email address
poc_classification: auth-bypass

## Vulnerability
The Miniorange Social Login and Register (Discord, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn) WordPress plugin is vulnerable to authentication bypass due to insufficient encryption on the user supplied during login validation. Unauthenticated attackers can log in as any existing user (e.g. administrator) if they know the associated email address. Partially patched in 7.6.4; fully fixed in 7.6.5. Impact includes unauthorized account access leading to data theft or privilege escalation (CVSS 9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single POST request to `/` with `option=moopenid` and hardcoded base64-encoded `email`/`appName` parameters. It verifies exploitation by matching a 302 status code together with `wordpress_sec_` or `wordpress_logged_in_` cookies in the Set-Cookie header.
