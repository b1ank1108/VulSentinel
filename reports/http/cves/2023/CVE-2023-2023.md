## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-2023 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Custom 404 Pro WordPress plugin versions prior to 3.7.3. The vulnerability exists in the search parameter (`s`) of the plugin's admin interface (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=c4p-main`) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. An authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the browser context of users viewing the affected page. This can lead to theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the victim's session.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), though exploitation requires authentication based on the template's detection method. The EPSS score of 0.75964 (98.886th percentile) indicates a high probability of exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs authenticated detection of this XSS vulnerability through a two-step process:

1. **Authentication**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with WordPress credentials to establish an authenticated session
2. **XSS Probe**: Sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=c4p-main` with a crafted search parameter containing an XSS payload: `{{randstr}}" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(document.domain)//`

The template verifies the vulnerability by checking that:
- The response returns HTTP 200 status
- The content type is `text/html`
- The injected payload (`onanimationstart=alert(document.domain)//`) is reflected in the response body
- The response contains "Custom 404 Pro" confirming the plugin is active

This detection method confirms the presence of the XSS vulnerability by demonstrating that malicious JavaScript can be injected and reflected without proper sanitization.
