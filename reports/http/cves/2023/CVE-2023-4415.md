## Vulnerability
Ruijie RG-EW1200G router firmware suffers from an improper authentication vulnerability (CWE-287) in the background management login endpoint `/api/sys/login`. The issue, rated critical, affects firmware 07161417 r483 and allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by manipulating login parameters. Public exploits exist. Impact includes potential full administrative access to the router, compromising network security. CVSS 3.1: 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Remediation requires firmware update to version newer than 07161417 r483.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single POST request to `{{BaseURL}}/api/sys/login` with JSON body `{"username":"2","password":"admin","timestamp":1695218596000}`. It verifies exploitation success by matching for `"result":"ok"` and `"msg":"登入成功"` (login success) in the body, `application/json` in headers, and HTTP 200 status.
