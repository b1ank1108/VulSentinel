## Vulnerability
qdPM 9.2 is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2023-45855, CWE-22) that permits unauthenticated attackers to list files and directories by navigating to the `/uploads` URI.  
**CVSS:** 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  
**Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade qdPM to a non-vulnerable version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/uploads/` and matches on HTTP 200 status together with the body containing both `"Index of /uploads</title>"` and `"attachments/</a>"` to confirm the directory listing is exposed.
