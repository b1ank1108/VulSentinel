## Vulnerability
Image Optimizer by 10web WordPress plugin before 1.0.26 suffers from reflected cross-site scripting via the `iowd_tabs_active` GET parameter in `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=iowd_settings`. Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping allow arbitrary JavaScript injection that executes in the victim's browser context.  

Impact: unauthenticated attackers can craft malicious links that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, steal cookie-based session credentials and enable further attacks.  

CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), CWE-79. Fixed in 1.0.27.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first authenticates by POSTing `log={{username}}&pwd={{password}}` to `/wp-login.php`, then sends a GET request to the settings endpoint with the payload `iowd_tabs_active=generalry8uo%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3da%20onerror%3dalert(document.domain)%3Ef0cmo`. Detection succeeds if the response is HTTP 200, HTML content-type, contains the unsanitized `<img src=a onerror=alert(document.domain)>` string, and includes "Image optimizer" text.
