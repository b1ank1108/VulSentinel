## Vulnerability
XWiki Platform Solr-based search discloses password hashes of all users (plus any plaintext passwords/API keys stored in viewable extension configurations) to anyone with view rights on the respective user profiles. By default all user profiles are public. No workarounds exist. Patched in 14.10.15, 15.5.2, 15.7-rc-1. CVSS 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to either `/bin/view/Main/Search` or `/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Search` using the Solr query `propertyvalue:?* AND reference:*.password`. It verifies exploitation by confirming both the strings `"hash:SHA</span>"` and `"XWikiUsers[0].password"` appear in the 200 OK response body (stop-at-first-match).
