## Vulnerability
The WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the `map_id` parameter on the admin map editor page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-google-maps-menu&action=edit`). All versions up to and including 9.0.28 are affected due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. Unauthenticated attackers can craft malicious links that, when clicked by an authenticated administrator, execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79. Impact includes potential theft of administrator session cookies or execution of administrative actions.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` using supplied `{{username}}` and `{{password}}` credentials, then issues a GET request to the vulnerable admin endpoint injecting the reflected XSS payload `1aa'><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>` into the `map_id` parameter. It verifies exploitation by checking that the response body contains the unsanitized payload string alongside legitimate page content (`Map Alignment</legend>`) and returns HTTP 200 with `text/html` content-type.
