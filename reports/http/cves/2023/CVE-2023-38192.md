## Vulnerability
SuperWebMailer 9.00.0.01710 is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The flaw occurs in superadmincreate.php when processing an incorrect Password field value; user-supplied input is reflected unsanitized inside an HTML attribute on the error response page.  

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).  
Successful exploitation enables script execution in the context of an authenticated victim (or any visitor to the page), leading to unauthorized access or data theft.  

No authentication is required to trigger the issue. No out-of-band interaction, version comparison logic, or special configuration flags are needed beyond the presence of the product itself.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/superadmincreate.php` containing the payload `Password=a"><script>alert(document.domain);</script>` (plus dummy PasswordAgain and Language fields). It verifies exploitation by confirming the exact unsanitized payload appears inside a `value="..."` attribute in the response body, the page contains the string "SuperWebMailer", the Content-Type is `text/html`, and the HTTP status is 200. This proves the XSS reflection condition without performing any destructive or state-changing actions.
