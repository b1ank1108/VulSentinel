## Vulnerability
PHPJabbers Fundraising Script v1.0 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the `action` parameter in `index.php` (CVE-2023-40751, CWE-79).  
Unauthenticated remote attackers can inject malicious JavaScript payloads. When a victim (typically an administrator) visits the crafted URL, arbitrary JS executes in the browser context, enabling theft of administrator credentials and manipulation of donation campaigns.  
CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).  
Remediation: Update to any version newer than 1.0 that sanitizes the `action` parameter. No additional deployment-mode, feature-toggle or configuration preconditions are required beyond the vulnerable version being reachable.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single POST request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?controller=pjAdmin&action=%3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dprompt%28document.domain%29%3E` (empty body) and confirms the flaw by verifying that the exact unsanitized payload string appears in the response body together with the string "didn't exists", HTTP status 200, and `text/html` content-type.
