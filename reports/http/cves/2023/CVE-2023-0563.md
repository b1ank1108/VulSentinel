## Vulnerability

A vulnerability classified as problematic (CWE-79) has been found in PHPGurukul Bank Locker Management System 1.0. It affects an unknown part of the Assign Locker component (description references manipulation of argument `ahname` in `add-locker-form.php`; template uses `searchinput` in `search-locker-details.php`). The flaw permits remote attackers to inject malicious scripts. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 4.8).

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information. Remediation: upgrade to the latest version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the vulnerability by sending a single POST request to `/search-locker-details.php` with form data `searchinput=%E2%80%9C%2F%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&submit=` (reflected XSS payload) and no authentication artifacts. It verifies success via status_code == 200, unsanitized reflection of `"/><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the response body, and presence of the string "Bank Locker Management System".
