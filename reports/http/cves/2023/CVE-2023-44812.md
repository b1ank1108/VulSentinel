## Vulnerability
mooSocial v.3.1.8 contains a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `admin_redirect_url` query parameter of the user login function at `/admin/home/login`. A remote unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript by supplying a crafted payload that is reflected unsanitized into the HTML response.

Description: A cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mooSocial v.3.1.8 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted payload to the admin_redirect_url parameter of the user login function.  
Impact: Allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template implements a two-step HTTP flow. First it issues a GET to `{{BaseURL}}` and uses an internal word matcher for "mooSocial" in the body to fingerprint the application. Second it sends a GET to `{{BaseURL}}/admin/home/login` with the query parameter `admin_redirect_url` set to a URL-encoded payload (`aHR0cDovL2xvY2FsaG9zdC9tb29zb2NpYWwvYWRtaW4vcGx1Z2lucw%22%3e%3cscript%3ealert(document.domain)%3c%2fscript%3etest`) that injects `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. After following up to two redirects it matches on status code 200, `text/html` Content-Type header, and literal presence of the injected `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` string in the response body to confirm reflection.
