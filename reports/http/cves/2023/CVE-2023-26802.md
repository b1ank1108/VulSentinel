## Vulnerability
Unauthenticated command injection in DCBI-Netlog-LAB v1.0 firmware (DCN Digital China Networks) affecting the network configuration component at `/network_config/nsg_masq.cgi` (probed at `/cgi-bin/network_config/nsg_masq.cgi`). Attackers bypass authentication via `session_id=../` path traversal and inject arbitrary OS commands through the `proto` parameter.

**Description**: An issue in the component `/network_config/nsg_masq.cgi` of DCN DCBI-Netlog-LAB v1.0 allows attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands via a crafted request.  
**Impact**: Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands, leading to complete device compromise and potential network infiltration.  
**CVSS**: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE**: 22  
**CPE**: cpe:2.3:o:dcnglobal:dcbi-netlog-lab_firmware:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template actively exploits to confirm RCE:  
- First raw GET to `/cgi-bin/network_config/nsg_masq.cgi?user_name=admin&session_id=../&lang=zh_CN.UTF-8&act=2&proto=;ls>/usr/local/lyx/lyxcenter/web/{{rand_text_alpha(4)}}.html` injects a command that writes `ls` output to a web-accessible file.  
- Second GET to the newly created `{{random}}.html` checks that the body contains both `"nsg_bridge.cgi"` and `"nsg_dhcpactiveip.cgi"` (legitimate files from directory listing) under HTTP 200.
