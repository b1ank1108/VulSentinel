## Vulnerability
EyouCms v1.6.3 contains an information disclosure vulnerability. An unauthenticated remote attacker can retrieve the file at `/data/model/custom_model_path/recruit.filelist.txt` (described as `/custom_model_path/recruit.filelist.txt` in the advisory), exposing internal paths such as `application/admin/` and `template/pc/`. This leaks application structure and configuration details that may assist further attacks.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3). CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/data/model/custom_model_path/recruit.filelist.txt` and verifies the response with an AND matcher: HTTP status 200 together with the body containing both words `"application/admin/"` and `"template/pc/"`.
