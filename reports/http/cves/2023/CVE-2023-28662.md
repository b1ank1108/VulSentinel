## Vulnerability
The Gift Cards (Gift Vouchers and Packages) WordPress Plugin, version <= 4.3.1, is affected by an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the template parameter in the wpgv_doajax_voucher_pdf_save_func action.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform SQL injection attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or further compromise of the WordPress site.

**Remediation:** Update the Gift Cards (Gift Vouchers and Packages) WordPress Plugin to the latest version available.

**CVSS:** 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE:** 89

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs plugin fingerprinting via GET /wp-content/plugins/gift-voucher/readme.txt (internal matcher for 'Gift Vouchers and Packages') followed by a POST to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php (action=wpgv_doajax_voucher_pdf_save_func&template=LTEgT1IgU0xFRVAoNik=) where the template value is a base64-encoded time-based blind SQLi payload equivalent to "-1 OR SLEEP(6)". Detection triggers if duration >= 6s AND status_code == 500 AND body contains 'critical error' (with @timeout: 20s).
