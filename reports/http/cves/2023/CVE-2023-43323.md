## Vulnerability

mooSocial 3.1.8 is vulnerable to external service interaction via multiple parameters in the post function, specifically allowing outbound requests to attacker-controlled URLs in the activity-sharing endpoint.

This manifests as a blind server-side request forgery (SSRF) / external interaction flaw when processing fields such as `data[userShareVideo]`.

**CVSS v3.1**: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
**Impact**: Unauthenticated remote attackers can force the server to interact with arbitrary external (or internal) services, enabling reconnaissance, potential data exfiltration, or further exploitation.  
**Remediation**: Upgrade to a patched version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first sends a GET request to `/` and internally matches the string `mooConfig` in the response body to confirm a mooSocial installation. It then issues a POST request to `/activities/ajax_share` with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` payload containing `data[userShareVideo]=http://{{interactsh-url}}/?null`. Detection triggers on receipt of an HTTP or DNS interaction via interactsh, confirming the server performed an outbound request to the injected URL.
