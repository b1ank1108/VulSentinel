## Vulnerability
The Integrate Google Drive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization due to absent capability checks on multiple REST API endpoints in versions up to and including 1.1.99. Unauthenticated attackers can perform operations such as moving files, creating folders, copying details, and more, enabling access and manipulation of sensitive Google Drive data. Fixed in 1.2.0. CVSS 3.1 score 7.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues an unauthenticated POST request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json/igd/v1/get-users-data` and verifies a 200 OK response with `application/json` Content-Type containing the strings `"username":`, `"name":`, `"email":`, and `"role":` in the body. This confirms the missing authorization flaw that permits broader unauthorized data modifications and operations during exploitation.
