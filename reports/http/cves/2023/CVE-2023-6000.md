## Vulnerability
WordPress Popup Builder plugin (<= 4.2.3) does not enforce authorization on popup updates, permitting unauthenticated visitors to modify existing popups and inject raw JavaScript. This results in stored XSS when the altered popups are later rendered to other users (including admins), enabling account takeover, session hijacking, or defacement. Fixed in 4.2.3.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template actively exploits the flaw to confirm reachability:  
- GET / harvests a live popup ID via regex `sgpb-main-popup-data-container-([0-9]+)`.  
- POST / (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) overwrites the popup using `post_ID=`, `sgpb-type=html`, and `sgpb-WillOpen=alert('document.domain')`.  
- DSL matcher verifies the injected payload appears verbatim in the response body alongside `popup-builder`, `text/html` Content-Type, and HTTP 200.  

This performs unauthorized data modification on the target popup.
