## Vulnerability
VMware Aria Operations for Logs contains a deserialization vulnerability (CWE-502). An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the application can execute arbitrary code as root. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Successful exploitation allows full system compromise via Java deserialization gadget.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the flaw by performing a two-request sequence that triggers the underlying deserialization without executing payload code:  
1. `GET /csrf` with `X-Csrf-Token: Fetch` to extract the CSRF token.  
2. `POST /api/v2/internal/cluster/applyMembership` supplying the token and a Java gadget (`generate_java_gadget("dns", "http://{{interactsh-url}}", "raw")`) serialized as `application/octet-stream`.  

Matchers require a DNS interaction on the interactsh domain plus the exact body string `"errorMessage":"Internal error"`. This confirms the deserialization path is reachable and exploitable for RCE.
