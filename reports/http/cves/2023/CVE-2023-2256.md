## Vulnerability
WordPress Product Addons & Fields for WooCommerce (woocommerce-product-addon) plugin before version 32.0.7 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. URL parameters in the admin panel are not properly sanitized/escaped, allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript that executes in an administrator's browser context (CWE-79). CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first fingerprints the plugin via a GET to the base URL, matching both "woocommerce-product-addon" and "woocommerce" strings in the body. It then authenticates by POSTing credentials to /wp-login.php and follows with a GET to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ppom&productmeta_id=5&do_meta=edit&%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E=1`, confirming the flaw if the exact unsanitized payload string appears in the response body (status 200, text/html).
