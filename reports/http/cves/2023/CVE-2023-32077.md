## Vulnerability

Netmaker, a WireGuard network management platform, contains a critical security flaw involving a hardcoded DNS secret key. The vulnerability (CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials, CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) allows unauthenticated users to interact with DNS API endpoints by using the hardcoded secret key "secretkey". This authentication bypass enables attackers to access and potentially manipulate DNS configurations within the Netmaker VPN infrastructure, which could lead to traffic redirection and network compromise. The vulnerability affects versions prior to 0.17.1 and 0.18.6.

The CVSS score of 7.5 (High) reflects the network-accessible attack vector with low complexity, requiring no privileges or user interaction. The EPSS score of 0.86556 (99.399th percentile) indicates a very high probability of active exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by attempting to access the DNS API endpoint at `/api/dns` using the hardcoded authorization header `Authorization: x secretkey`. The detection verifies successful exploitation by checking for:

1. HTTP 200 status code response
2. JSON content type in the response headers
3. Presence of DNS configuration data in the response body containing fields like `address`, `network`, and `name`

A successful match confirms that the hardcoded secret key grants unauthorized access to DNS API endpoints, exposing sensitive DNS configuration information without proper authentication.
