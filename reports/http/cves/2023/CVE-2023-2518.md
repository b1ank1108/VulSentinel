## Vulnerability
The Easy Forms for Mailchimp WordPress plugin prior to version 6.8.9 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through the unsanitized `sql_error` parameter on the `yikes-mailchimp-edit-form` admin page. This occurs specifically when the debug option is enabled, allowing arbitrary JavaScript injection that executes in an authenticated administrator's browser context (CWE-79, CVSS 6.1).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first fingerprints the plugin presence via a GET request to the root path, matching for "yikes-inc-easy-mailchimp-extender" in the body. It then performs authentication by POSTing username/password credentials to `/wp-login.php`. Finally, it issues a GET request to the vulnerable admin endpoint with the encoded XSS payload in the `sql_error` query parameter (`<svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`) and confirms successful reflection by matching the unsanitized payload in the response body, along with HTTP 200 status and text/html content-type.
