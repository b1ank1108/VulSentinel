## Vulnerability
The MyCryptoCheckout WordPress plugin before version 2.124 does not escape some URLs before outputting them in HTML attributes on the autosettlements settings page, resulting in reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.  
Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context (authenticated admin required to visit crafted link), enabling session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.  
Remediation: update to 2.124 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template first performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` with supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials, then issues a GET to `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=mycryptocheckout&tab=autosettlements&"><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>` and matches on HTTP 200, `text/html` Content-Type, presence of `mycryptocheckout` string, and unescaped payload reflected in the response body.
