## Vulnerability
Simple URLs WordPress plugin versions prior to 115 is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `search` parameter (and others) before outputting them in admin pages such as `/wp-content/plugins/simple-urls/admin/assets/js/import-js.php`, enabling malicious JavaScript injection. The flaw targets high-privilege users (e.g., administrators) and carries CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1, CWE-79). Successful exploitation can result in session hijacking, website defacement, sensitive information theft, or further compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

Template first sends POST to `/wp-login.php` with `log={{username}}&pwd={{password}}` to authenticate, then issues GET `/wp-content/plugins/simple-urls/admin/assets/js/import-js.php?search=%3C/script%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(document.domain)%3E`. It verifies the reflected XSS condition with DSL matchers requiring `status_code_2 == 200`, unsanitized payload present in response body, and `"search_term"` present in the prior response body.
