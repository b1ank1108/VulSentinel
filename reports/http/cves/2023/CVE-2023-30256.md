## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-30256 is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Webkul QloApps version 1.5.2. The vulnerability exists in the AuthController.php file, specifically in the handling of the `back` and `email_create` parameters. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through these parameters, which are not properly sanitized before being reflected in the application's response. This reflected XSS vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the context of a victim's browser session when they interact with a crafted URL.

The vulnerability requires no authentication to exploit (tagged as `unauth`), making it accessible to any remote attacker. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure, session hijacking, credential theft, or website defacement. The CVSS score of 6.1 (Medium severity) reflects the network-based attack vector with low complexity, but requires user interaction (UI:R) as the victim must click on or visit a malicious link.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the authentication controller endpoint with crafted XSS payloads in the `back` parameter. The payload `xss onfocus=alert(document.domain) autofocus= xss` is designed to trigger JavaScript execution through the `onfocus` event handler with autofocus attribute.

The template verifies the vulnerability through three conditions:
1. The response body contains the reflected XSS payload string "xss onfocus=alert(document.domain) autofocus= xss" and the string "hasConfirmation", indicating the malicious input was reflected without proper sanitization
2. The response Content-Type header is `text/html`, confirming the payload is rendered in an HTML context
3. The HTTP response status is 200, indicating successful request processing

The detection approach confirms that user-supplied input in the `back` parameter is reflected in the HTML response without adequate encoding or filtering, making the application vulnerable to XSS attacks.
