severity: medium

affected_versions: <= 2.5.5
preconditions: Contact Form Generator plugin installed and activated on a WordPress site; requires tricking an authenticated administrator into clicking crafted link

## Vulnerability
The Contact Form Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the `id` parameter in `wp-admin/admin.php` in versions up to and including 2.5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that execute in the context of the victim (e.g., administrator), enabling session cookie theft when users click crafted links.

CVSS v3.1 score: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). CWE-79.

Remediation: Update to version 2.5.6 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template authenticates to WordPress via POST to `/wp-login.php` using supplied credentials, followed by a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with the payload `id=1<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. It detects successful reflection by matching the unsanitized `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` string and "contact_form_generator" in the response body, along with appropriate content-type and HTTP 200 status.
