## Vulnerability
WordPress Japanized for WooCommerce plugin before 2.5.8 is susceptible to reflected cross-site scripting via the `tab` parameter due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. An attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting authenticated user (typically an administrator) in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Successful exploitation could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1)  
CWE-79  
Fixed in version 2.5.8.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` using supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials, then issues a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=peachpay&tab=field&"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. It detects successful reflection by verifying HTTP 200, text/html content-type, presence of the unsanitized `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` payload in the response body, and confirmation that the peachpay admin page is rendered.
