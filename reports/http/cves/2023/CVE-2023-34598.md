## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-34598 is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability affecting Gibbon v25.0.0. The vulnerability allows an attacker to include and read the contents of files present in the installation folder through the server's response. This is a path traversal issue (CWE-22) that enables unauthorized access to sensitive files without requiring authentication. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical) with an EPSS score of 0.90829, indicating a very high probability of exploitation in the wild. The flaw can expose sensitive information such as database dumps and configuration files, potentially leading to further system compromise.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to `/?q=./gibbon.sql`, attempting to access the Gibbon SQL database dump file through path traversal. The detection verifies successful exploitation by checking for:
1. The presence of both "phpMyAdmin SQL Dump" and "gibbon" strings in the response body
2. An HTTP 200 status code

If both conditions are met, the template confirms that the LFI vulnerability exists and the attacker can read the database dump file, which typically contains sensitive information including database structure and potentially credentials or other confidential data.
