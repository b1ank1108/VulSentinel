affected_product: PaperCut NG
severity: medium

preconditions: []

## Vulnerability
PaperCut NG exposes its XML-RPC interface at `/rpc/clients/xmlrpc` with no authentication required by default. This improper authentication (CWE-287) permits any remote attacker to invoke arbitrary XML-RPC methods, including configuration retrieval and potentially more impactful operations.

Impact: potential remote code execution or unauthorized access to sensitive information.  
CVSS 3.1: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).  
Remediation: apply latest vendor security patches and updates.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single raw POST request containing a benign XML-RPC `<methodCall>` to `client.getGlobalConfig`. Detection confirms the flaw when the response body contains both `conf.ssl-port` and `conf.auth-ttl-default`, the `Content-Type` header is `text/xml`, and status code is 200. This probe verifies unauthenticated method execution without performing any destructive action.
