## Vulnerability
Progress MOVEit Transfer web application contains a SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89) that permits an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database by submitting a crafted payload to an application endpoint. This results in modification and disclosure of MOVEit database content, leading to data breach and potential system compromise.

**CVSS:** 9.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)  
**Impact:** Attackers can modify and disclose sensitive database content.  
**Remediation:** Update to fixed versions 2020.1.10 (12.1.10), 2021.0.8 (13.0.8), 2021.1.6 (13.1.6), 2022.0.6 (14.0.6), 2022.1.7 (14.1.7), or 2023.0.3 (15.0.3) (or later).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues a GET request to `/machine.aspx` with a specially crafted `X-IPSGW-ClientCert` header containing an X.509 certificate whose subject embeds the time-based SQL injection payload `SELECT SLEEP(6)`. Detection succeeds if the response duration is >= 6 seconds (confirming payload execution), the body contains both `<siLockResponse>` and `<ErrorCode>`, and the status code is 200. This verifies the blind SQL injection flaw that enables unauthorized database modification.
