## Vulnerability
Emlog Pro v2.1.14 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the `/admin/store.php` endpoint. The flaw stems from lack of sanitization/escaping of query-string parameters, allowing arbitrary JavaScript injection that is echoed back into the HTML response.

CVSS 3.1 Base Score: 6.1 (Medium)  
Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  
CWE: CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation)  

Successful exploitation can lead to client-side script execution in the victim's browser context, resulting in unauthorized access or data theft (e.g., session cookies, page content).

Remediation: Update Emlog Pro to the latest version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `/admin/store.php?"onmouseover='alert(document.domain)'bad="` and confirms the vulnerability when the exact unsanitized payload string is reflected verbatim in the response body (alongside the keyword "emlog"), the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
