## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-33338 is a critical SQL Injection vulnerability in Old Age Home Management System version 1.0. The vulnerability exists in the login functionality, specifically in the `username` parameter of the `/admin/login.php` endpoint. An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious SQL code through this parameter to manipulate the authentication query, bypassing login controls entirely.

The SQL injection allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the backend database. This can lead to complete authentication bypass, unauthorized administrative access, data leakage, and potential data manipulation or deletion. The vulnerability is classified with a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical) due to its network-based attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required, and high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

The flaw is categorized as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command) and has an EPSS score of 0.66882 (98.514th percentile), indicating a high probability of exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a two-step detection process to verify the SQL injection vulnerability and resulting authentication bypass:

1. **SQL Injection Attempt**: Sends a POST request to `/admin/login.php` with a crafted SQL injection payload in the username parameter: `vaday' or 1=1#`. This payload attempts to manipulate the SQL query to always evaluate to true, bypassing authentication logic. A dummy password is provided.

2. **Access Verification**: Follows up with a GET request to `/admin/dashboard.php` to verify successful authentication bypass by checking if the admin dashboard is accessible.

The template confirms successful exploitation by validating:
- HTTP 200 status code on the dashboard access
- Presence of "Change Password" text in the response body
- Presence of "Old Age Home Management System|| Dashboard" text in the response body

These indicators confirm that the SQL injection successfully bypassed authentication and granted unauthorized administrative access to the system.
