## Vulnerability
Request-Baskets <= 1.2.1 allows unauthenticated SSRF via the `forward_url` parameter when creating a new basket (CWE-918, CVE-2023-27163).  

**Impact:** Attackers can perform SSRF attacks to access internal network resources, scan internal systems, or interact with services that should not be accessible from external networks.  

**Remediation:** Upgrade to Request-Baskets version 1.2.2 or later that addresses this SSRF vulnerability.  

**CVSS:** 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a POST to `/api/baskets/{{rand_base(7)}}` with JSON payload setting `"forward_url": "http://{{interactsh-url}}"`, `"proxy_response": true`, and other basket options, asserting status_code == 201, token presence in body, and JSON content-type. It then sends a GET to `/{{bucketname}}` to trigger the forward. The SSRF is confirmed when an OOB HTTP callback is received (interactsh_protocol matcher == "http").
