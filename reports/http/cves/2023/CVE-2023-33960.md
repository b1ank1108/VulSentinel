## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-33960 is an information disclosure vulnerability in OpenProject versions prior to 12.5.6. The application generates a publicly accessible `robots.txt` file that exposes project identifiers, even when the instance is configured with 'Login required' settings. This allows unauthenticated attackers to enumerate project information that should be protected behind authentication controls.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.3 (Medium severity). The CVSS vector (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) indicates network-based exploitation requiring no privileges, no user interaction, with low confidentiality impact.

Attackers can leverage the exposed project identifiers to gather intelligence about the organization's projects, potentially facilitating targeted attacks or reconnaissance activities. The vulnerability requires no authentication to exploit, making it accessible to any remote attacker with network access to the OpenProject instance.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an HTTP GET request to `/robots.txt` on the target OpenProject instance. It verifies the presence of the vulnerability through three conditions:

1. The response returns HTTP status code 200 (successful request)
2. The response body contains the string "Disallow: /projects/" indicating project-related paths are listed
3. The response body contains at least one of the following strings: "/work_packages", "/repository", or "/activity" - all of which are project-specific paths that should not be publicly disclosed

The detection confirms that the robots.txt file is publicly accessible and contains sensitive project identifier information that should be protected when the instance requires authentication.
