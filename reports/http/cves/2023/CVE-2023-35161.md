## Vulnerability
XWiki Platform versions >= 6.2-milestone-1 suffer from a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in the AppWithinMinutes/DeleteApplication endpoint. An attacker can forge a URL injecting arbitrary JavaScript via the unsanitized `xredirect` parameter (e.g. `?appName=Menu&resolve=true&xredirect=javascript:alert(document.domain)`). The issue has existed since XWiki 6.2-milestone-1 and was fixed in 14.10.5 and 15.1-rc-1. CVSS 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Impact: successful exploitation allows JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template performs two GET requests (paths `/xwiki/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/DeleteApplication?...` and `/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/DeleteApplication?...`) with the `javascript:alert(document.domain)` payload embedded in `xredirect`. Detection succeeds if the response body simultaneously contains the exact payload string, `DeleteApplication`, and `data-xwiki` (AND condition), the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and status is 200 or 401. `stop-at-first-match: true` is used.
