## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-0600 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the WP Visitor Statistics (Real Time Traffic) WordPress plugin affecting versions prior to 6.9. The vulnerability exists because the plugin fails to properly escape user input that is concatenated into SQL queries. Specifically, the `visitorId` parameter in the tracking functionality is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

This is an unauthenticated vulnerability, meaning any visitor to a WordPress site running the affected plugin can exploit it without requiring any credentials or prior access. The vulnerability allows attackers to conduct time-based blind SQL injection attacks, which can be leveraged to extract the entire WordPress database including sensitive information such as user credentials, password hashes, and site statistics.

The flaw is classified as CWE-89 (SQL Injection) with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating maximum severity across confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts. The EPSS score of 0.77404 (98.953rd percentile) suggests a high probability of active exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs a two-step detection process:

1. **Fingerprinting**: The template first verifies the presence of the WP Visitor Statistics plugin by requesting `/wp-content/plugins/wp-statistics/readme.txt` and checking for the string "Real Time Traffic" to confirm the plugin is installed.

2. **SQL Injection Verification**: If the plugin is detected, the template sends a crafted GET request to the WordPress site with a malicious `visitorId` parameter containing a time-based SQL injection payload: `{{random_number}}',sleep(6),0,0,0,0,0);--+-`. This payload attempts to inject a SQL `sleep(6)` command.

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking three conditions:
- The response takes 6 or more seconds to return (indicating the sleep command executed)
- The HTTP status code is 200
- The response body contains the string "sleep(6)"

The timeout is set to 30 seconds to accommodate the intentional delay. This time-based blind SQL injection technique confirms the vulnerability is exploitable without requiring data exfiltration in the detection phase itself.
