## Vulnerability
MinIO is susceptible to information disclosure. In cluster/distributed deployments starting with RELEASE.2019-12-17T23-16-33Z and prior to RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z, the bootstrap verify endpoint returns all environment variables, including MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD, MINIO_ROOT_USER and MINIO_SECRET_KEY. An unauthenticated attacker can obtain sensitive credentials, enabling potential data modification or unauthorized operations. All distributed deployments are impacted. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5). Remediation: upgrade to RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs an unauthenticated POST /minio/bootstrap/v1/verify (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded) and confirms the leak when the response body contains any of '"MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD":', '"MINIO_ROOT_USER":' or '"MinioEnv":' (OR condition), the Content-Type header is text/plain and status is 200.
