severity: high

external_callback: false
affected_versions: all versions released since April 2015, starting with 3.10.0 (prior to 4.6.8 and 4.7.5)

## Vulnerability
Openfire Administration Console (XMPP server web admin interface) is vulnerable to a path traversal attack (CWE-22) in the setup environment. This allows unauthenticated attackers to access restricted administrative pages reserved for logged-in admin users by leveraging the setup-s endpoint in already-configured instances. 

Successful exploitation grants unauthorized console access (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N - 7.5 High). Affects all versions released since April 2015 starting with 3.10.0. Impact includes full administrative console access. Patched in releases 4.7.5 and 4.6.8; further mitigations in upcoming 4.8 branch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues an unsafe raw GET request using double Unicode-encoded directory traversal to reach the protected log.jsp page without authentication: `GET /setup/setup-s/%u002e%u002e/%u002e%u002e/log.jsp`. It verifies success via AND matchers on HTTP 200 status and presence of multiple admin/console identifiers in the body ("apache" AND "java" AND "openfire" AND "jivesoftware").
