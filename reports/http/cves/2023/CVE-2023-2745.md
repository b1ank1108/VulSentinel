## Vulnerability

WordPress Core is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including, 6.2, via the ‘wp_lang’ parameter on wp-login.php (CWE-22). 

CVSS: 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).

This allows unauthenticated attackers to access and load arbitrary translation files. In cases where an attacker is able to upload a crafted translation file onto the site, such as via an upload form, this could be also used to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack. Impact includes information disclosure of sensitive files such as wp-config.php (containing DB_NAME/DB_PASSWORD).

Remediation: Apply the latest security patches and updates from the vendor to address this vulnerability.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

Template first fingerprints a WordPress installation with GET / and checks for "/wp-content/plugins" in body (internal matcher). It then performs POST /wp-login.php with log={{username}}&pwd={{password}} (login step) followed immediately by GET /wp-login.php?wp_lang=../../../../../../../wp-config.php. Detection succeeds if the final response body contains both "DB_NAME" and "DB_PASSWORD" strings and status_code == 200.
