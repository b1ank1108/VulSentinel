## Vulnerability
Home Assistant Supervisor is vulnerable to authentication bypass (CWE-287) allowing remote unauthenticated access to the Supervisor API via path-traversal obfuscation in `/api/hassio/app/` and `/api/hassio_ingress/` endpoints.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 10.0).  
Impact: full unauthorized Supervisor API access, enabling further system compromise.  
Not affected: Home Assistant Container or manual Core Python installs. Fixed in Supervisor 2023.03.1 (auto-rolled out) and Core 2023.3.0.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template sends three raw GET requests (stop-at-first-match) using encoded traversal payloads `/.%252e/supervisor/info` and `/.%09./supervisor/info` (plus mitigation-bypass variant with `X-Hass-Is-Admin:1` header) to reach the protected `/supervisor/info` endpoint. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 + `application/json` Content-Type containing the words `"slug":`, `"name":` and `"ip_address"`.
