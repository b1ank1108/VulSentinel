## Vulnerability

The Login Configurator WordPress plugin version 2.1 and earlier contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The vulnerability stems from improper escaping of URL parameters before outputting them to the page. Specifically, the `tab` parameter in the plugin's options page (`wp-admin/options-general.php?page=login-configurator-options`) is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

The vulnerability requires social engineering to exploit, as the victim (typically a site administrator) must be tricked into visiting a specially crafted malicious URL. Upon visiting the URL, the injected script executes in the context of the administrator's session, potentially leading to session hijacking, account compromise, or other malicious actions performed with administrative privileges.

The CVSS v3.1 score is 6.1 (Medium), with the vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, indicating network-based attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required, but user interaction required, with changed scope and low confidentiality and integrity impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs a two-step detection process:

1. **Initial verification**: Sends a GET request to the base URL to confirm the Login Configurator plugin is installed by checking for the presence of "login-configurator" in the response body.

2. **XSS payload injection**: If the plugin is detected, sends a GET request to the plugin's settings page with a malicious `tab` parameter containing an XSS payload: `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=login-configurator-options&tab="><script>alert(document.domain)</script>#top`

The template verifies the vulnerability by checking that:
- The injected script tag `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` appears unescaped in the response body
- The response contains "login-configurator" (confirming the correct page)
- The content type is "text/html"
- The HTTP status code is 200

This detection method confirms the presence of the reflected XSS vulnerability by demonstrating that user-supplied input is reflected in the HTML response without proper sanitization.
