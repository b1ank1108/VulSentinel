## Vulnerability
Mingsoft MCMS < 5.3.1 contains a cross-site scripting flaw in the HTTP POST Request Handler component at search.do. Unsanitized manipulation of the `style` argument allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript. The flaw is publicly disclosed (VDB-235611), requires no authentication, and is exploitable over the network.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1). CWE-79. Impact includes unauthorized access to sensitive data. Remediation: update to version 5.4 or above.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET / request and matches the string "mingsoft.net" (internal product fingerprint). It then sends a POST /mcms/search.do request with the reflected XSS payload `content_title=1&style=%3CScRiPt%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C%2FScRiPt%3Ealert`. Detection succeeds if the exact payload string appears unsanitized in the response body, the Content-Type is text/html, and the status code is 200.
