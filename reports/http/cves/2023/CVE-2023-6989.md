## Vulnerability
The Shield Security WP Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (CWE-22) via the `render_action_template` parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server up to version 18.5.9, enabling remote code execution and full site compromise. CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Impact includes complete WordPress installation compromise. Remediation requires updating to version 18.5.10 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a single POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the body `action=shield_action&ex=generic_render&exnonce=5a988a925a&render_action_template=../../icwp-wpsf.php`. Detection succeeds if the response returns HTTP 200, `Content-Type: application/json` header, and the body simultaneously contains the strings `"dashboard_shield"`, `"shield_action"`, and `"search_shield"`. This confirms the LFI by successfully including and executing the target PHP file.
