## Vulnerability
Jms Blog (jmsblog) module for PrestaShop contains a time-based blind SQL injection in the comment submission endpoint (`/module/jmsblog/index.php?action=submitComment`).  
The flaw is triggered via the `email` form parameter using a classic time-delay payload.  
CWE-89, CVSS 3.1 score 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Impact includes full database dump, admin credential extraction, and potential system compromise.  
Remediation requires upgrading the module.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  

The template first issues a GET / request (internal matcher) to confirm the Jms Blog module is present by checking for the string "jmsblog" in the response body.  
It then sends a crafted multipart POST to the comment endpoint with the payload `0'XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(6),0))XOR'Z` injected into the `email` field and verifies that the server response time is >= 6 seconds, confirming time-based blind SQL injection.
