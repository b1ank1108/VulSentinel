## Vulnerability
Ultimate Member WordPress plugin < 2.6.7 (CVE-2023-3460, CWE-269) allows unauthenticated visitors to create accounts with arbitrary capabilities, including administrator. The registration form accepts and honors `wp_capabilities[administrator]=1` without sanitization or permission checks.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8).  
Actively exploited in the wild.  
Remediation: upgrade to 2.6.7 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

Template executes a 4-request chain that fully exploits the flaw to confirm it:  
1. GET `/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-member/readme.txt` → confirms plugin presence and extracts Stable.tag version.  
2. GET `/index.php/register/` → extracts `form_id`, `_wpnonce`, and redirect `path`.  
3. POST crafted registration (random username/password/email + `wp_capabilities[administrator]=1`).  
4. Verifies 302 redirect + `wordpress_logged_in_[a-z0-9]{32}` cookie in headers.  
Extracts and logs created `WP_USERNAME` / `WP_PASSWORD` for immediate use.
