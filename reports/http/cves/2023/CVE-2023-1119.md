## Vulnerability

CVE-2023-1119 is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the WP-Optimize WordPress plugin versions prior to 3.2.13 and the SrbTransLatin WordPress plugin versions prior to 2.4.1. The vulnerability stems from a third-party library used by these plugins that improperly handles HTML character escaping. 

Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this flaw by injecting malicious JavaScript code through search parameters. The improper escaping allows the injected script to execute in the context of a victim's browser session, potentially enabling the theft of WordPress user session cookies and other sensitive information. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity), requiring user interaction but no authentication.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs a two-step detection process:

1. **Initial Check**: Sends a GET request to the base URL to verify the presence of the WP-Optimize plugin by searching for the string "/wp-content/plugins/wp-optimize" in the response body.

2. **XSS Verification**: If the plugin is detected, the template sends a crafted GET request with an XSS payload in the search parameter: `/?s=<%2Fscript><script>alert%28document.domain%29<%2Fscript>`. This payload attempts to close an existing script tag and inject a new one that would execute `alert(document.domain)`.

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking for:
- The reflected XSS payload (`</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`) in the response body
- The presence of the word "Search" indicating a search results page
- A content-type of `text/html`
- An HTTP 200 status code

This detection method verifies that user-supplied input is improperly escaped and reflected in the HTML output, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
