## Vulnerability
Adobe ColdFusion versions 2023.5 (and earlier) and 2021.11 (and earlier) suffer from an Improper Access Control vulnerability (CWE-284) that permits a security feature bypass. An unauthenticated attacker can reach protected administration CFM and CFC endpoints (such as administrator.cfc) without credentials or user interaction. Successful exploitation grants access to administrative APIs, enabling full server control and exposure of sensitive application data. CVSS 3.1 score is 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). Fixed by upgrading to 2023.6 or 2021.12 and later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template issues one raw GET request to `/hax/..CFIDE/adminapi/administrator.cfc?method=getBuildNumber&_cfclient=true`. It matches on HTTP 200 status together with the words `wddxPacket version=` and `<string>` appearing in the response body, confirming the administration endpoint was successfully invoked without authentication.
