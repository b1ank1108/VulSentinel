## Vulnerability
SolarView Compact 6.00 firmware (Contec) contains an OS command injection vulnerability (CWE-77) in downloader.php. Unauthenticated remote attackers can bypass internal restrictions and execute arbitrary OS commands by injecting payloads into the `file` parameter (semicolon + null-byte termination).

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Successful exploitation results in full remote code execution, compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the vulnerability by sending a single unauthenticated GET request:  
`GET /downloader.php?file=%3Becho+CVE-2023-23333|rev%00.zip`  
It then matches on:  
- HTTP status 200  
- `text/html` present in the Content-Type header  
- regex match for `33332-3202-EVC` (reversed output of the injected `echo … | rev` command) in the response body  

This confirms successful command execution and in-band output reflection.
