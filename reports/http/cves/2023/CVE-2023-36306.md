## Vulnerability
Adiscon LogAnalyzer through version 4.1.13 suffers from a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `asktheoracle.php`. The `uid` parameter is insufficiently sanitized, allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript via a crafted URL. 

Unauthenticated remote attackers can exploit this to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser context (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, score 6.1). Primary impact is theft of admin session cookies and unauthorized access to sensitive log analysis data.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/loganalyzer/asktheoracle.php?type=domain&query=&uid=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E` containing a reflected XSS payload. It matches on HTTP 200 status, text/html content-type, and confirms the unsanitized payload appears in the response body alongside the "Adiscon LogAnalyzer" string to validate the vulnerability.
