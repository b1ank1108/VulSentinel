## Vulnerability
Mlflow is vulnerable to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue (CVE-2023-6568, CWE-79). The application fails to sanitize or escape the Content-Type header value in 400 error responses generated by the `/api/2.0/mlflow/users/create` endpoint when an invalid content type is supplied in a POST request.  

The injected payload is reflected verbatim in the HTML response body, enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of a victim's browser session.  

- CVSS: 6.1 (Medium) – CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N  
- Impact: Allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's session  
- No version range or additional configuration preconditions are specified in the template (CPE covers all versions of lfprojects:mlflow).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single POST request to `/api/2.0/mlflow/users/create` containing the payload `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the Content-Type header. It verifies exploitation conditions via an AND matcher requiring: status code 400, response Content-Type `text/html`, and the response body simultaneously containing both the unsanitized payload string and the string "Invalid content type:". This confirms unsafe reflection of user-controlled header data into an HTML context.
