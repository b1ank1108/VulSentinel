## Vulnerability
WP Job Portal WordPress plugin before 2.0.6 fails to sanitise/escape the `city` parameter before using it in a SQL statement. The flaw is exploitable by unauthenticated users via the job search form and permits extraction of the complete WordPress database (including user credentials and job portal data) or potential full compromise of the installation.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N (8.6)  
CWE-89  
Remediation: update to 2.0.6 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a single POST request to `/wp-job-portal-jobseeker-controlpanel/jobs` containing the time-based blind payload `city=(select*from(select(sleep(7)))a)` inside an otherwise legitimate job-search form. It confirms the vulnerability when the response duration is ≥7 s, status_code is 200, and the body still contains the plugin identifier string.
