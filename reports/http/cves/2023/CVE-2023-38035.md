## Vulnerability
A security vulnerability in the MICS Admin Portal of Ivanti Sentry (MobileIron Sentry) versions 9.18.0 and below allows an attacker to bypass authentication controls on the administrative interface due to an insufficiently restrictive Apache HTTPD configuration. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8) | CWE-863.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated raw POST request to `/mics/services/MICSLogService` containing a base64-encoded payload (decoded command references `uploadFileUsingFileInputMS` with embedded `curl` to a padded interactsh URL). Matchers verify success with `status_code == 200`, body containing `isRunningTzz`, and DNS interactsh callback.
