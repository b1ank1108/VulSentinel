## Vulnerability
A path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22, CVSS 7.5) in the iclock API of ZKTeco BioTime v8.5.5 allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files by supplying a crafted payload to the `url` parameter. Impact includes potential exposure of employee biometric data, attendance records, and system credentials. Remediation requires updating to a version newer than 8.5.5 with proper file-path validation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw GET request `GET /iclock/file?url=/../../../../../../../../../windows/win.ini HTTP/1.1` to the target and matches on `status_code == 200`, `contains(header, "text/plain")`, and `contains_all(base64_decode(body), "; for 16-bit app support", "[extensions]")` to confirm successful retrieval of the Windows `win.ini` file.
