## Vulnerability
CVE-2023-27351 is an authentication bypass in PaperCut NG (also affecting PaperCut MF per CPE metadata) version 22.0.5 (Build 63914). The flaw resides in the SecurityRequestFilter class due to improper implementation of the authentication algorithm (CWE-287). Authentication is explicitly not required to exploit.  

**CVSS v3.0**: 8.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)  
**Impact**: Remote unauthenticated attackers can bypass auth controls, gaining unauthorized system access and enabling privileged operations (confidentiality high, integrity low).  
**Remediation**: Update to the latest version of PaperCut NG/MF or apply the vendor security patch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  

The template verifies the vulnerability with a two-step unauthenticated flow:  
1. `POST /rpc/api/rest/master/user/createInternalUser;/keepalive` using a randomly generated username/password JSON payload. Internal matcher checks for 200 OK, `application/json` content-type, and Java serialized object indicator (`rO0A`) in body.  
2. `POST /rpc/api/rest/master/user/getExportedUser;/keepalive` using the same username. Matcher confirms 200 OK, `application/json`, and response body containing `java.lang.String`, `HASH:`, and the created username.  

Successful completion proves the auth bypass permits internal user creation and data export without credentials.
