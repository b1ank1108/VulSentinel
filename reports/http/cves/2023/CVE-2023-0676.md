## Vulnerability
phpIPAM prior to 1.5.1 contains a reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) in the bandwidth calculator result handler at `/app/tools/ip-calculator/bw-calculator-result.php`. User input from the `delay` parameter is reflected unsanitized into the HTML response.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the context of an authenticated victim's browser session.

Impact: session token theft, credential harvesting, or arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim.  
Remediation: update phpipam/phpipam to 1.5.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a POST login request to `/app/login/login_check.php` with `ipamusername` and `ipampassword`, verifying "Login successful" in the response. It then issues a second POST to `/app/tools/ip-calculator/bw-calculator-result.php` (with Referer and X-Requested-With headers) containing the payload `delay=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. Detection succeeds if the second response body contains the unsanitized script tag, has `text/html` content-type, and returns status 200.

This confirms reflected XSS, enabling client-side information disclosure (e.g., reading `document.cookie` or other session data).
