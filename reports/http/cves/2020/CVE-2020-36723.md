## Vulnerability
ListingPro (WordPress Directory & Listing Theme by Cridio) contains an unauthenticated sensitive data disclosure flaw (CWE-200) in `listingpro-plugin/functions.php` prior to version 2.6.1. Any remote attacker can extract usernames, full names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and user post counts for all registered users via a single unauthenticated HTTP request. CVSS 3.1 score 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin/index.php?download-lp-users=yes` and confirms exploitation by matching all of the following in the response: body contains "UserName", "Email", "Full Name", and "Listings" (AND condition), Content-Disposition header contains "filename=", and HTTP status 200. The response is the actual CSV export of all user records.
