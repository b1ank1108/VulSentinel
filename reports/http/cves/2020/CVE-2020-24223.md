## Vulnerability

Mara CMS version 7.5 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `contact.php` file. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `theme` and `pagetheme` parameters. When user-supplied data is reflected in the HTTP response without proper encoding, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a victim's browser session.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). The attack vector is network-based with low attack complexity, requires no privileges but does require user interaction, and has a changed scope with low impact to confidentiality and integrity.

Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, website defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to `/contact.php` with a crafted `theme` parameter containing an XSS payload: `tes"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. 

The detection mechanism verifies three conditions:
1. The injected payload `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` is reflected in the response body without sanitization
2. The response Content-Type header is `text/html`, confirming the payload is rendered in an HTML context
3. The server returns a 200 OK status code

If all three conditions are met, the vulnerability is confirmed as the application fails to properly encode or filter the malicious input before including it in the HTML response.
