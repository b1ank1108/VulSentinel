## Vulnerability
WordPress File Manager Plugin (webdesi9) prior to version 6.9 is susceptible to remote code execution. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to upload .php files via the elFinder connector endpoint.  
Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected WordPress site.  
CVSS v3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type  
Remediation: Update to the latest version of the WordPress File Manager Plugin.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs a single raw POST request with multipart/form-data boundary to `/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/php/connector.minimal.php`, submitting `cmd=upload`, `target=l1_Lw`, and a benign `poc.txt` file (content: poc-test). Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 + `application/json` Content-Type + response body containing both "poc.txt" and "added". Uploaded files become accessible at `/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/poc.txt`. This harmless probe confirms the unrestricted file-upload flaw that can be abused by uploading .php webshells for full RCE.
