## Vulnerability
Pinger 1.0 is affected by a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CWE-78, CVSS 9.8: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Unsanitized `ping` and `socket` parameters in `ping.php` allow injection of arbitrary shell commands and metacharacters, enabling unauthenticated attackers to execute system commands and write arbitrary PHP files to the server.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` and matches the word "ping.php" in the response body to confirm presence of the vulnerable endpoint. It then issues a raw POST to `/ping.php` with the payload `ping=127.0.0.1;echo+{{md5('CVE-2020-37123')}}` (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded) and verifies exploitation success by matching the rendered MD5 hash string in the response body together with HTTP 200 status.
