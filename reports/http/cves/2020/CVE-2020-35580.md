## Vulnerability

SearchBlox prior to version 9.2.2 suffers from a local file inclusion vulnerability in the FileServlet component. Remote unauthenticated attackers can exploit the `/searchblox/servlet/FileServlet?col=url=` parameter to read arbitrary files on the server filesystem. This includes the main configuration file (`searchblox/WEB-INF/config.xml`) that exposes the Super Admin API key and base64-encoded SHA1 password hashes for other users.

- CVSS v3.1: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
- CWE: CWE-22
- Impact: Sensitive data exposure including credentials and configuration.
- Remediation: Upgrade to version 9.2.2 or newer.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The nuclei template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/searchblox/servlet/FileServlet?col=9&url=/etc/passwd` and checks the response body with a regex matcher for `root:.*:0:0:` to confirm successful inclusion of the system passwd file.
