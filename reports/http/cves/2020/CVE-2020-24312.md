## Vulnerability
WP File Manager (wp-file-manager) plugin for WordPress versions v6.4 and lower fails to restrict external access to the `fm_backup` directory (located at `/wp-content/uploads/wp-file-manager-pro/fm_backup/`) due to a missing restrictive .htaccess file. This allows unauthenticated users to browse the directory index and download site backups, which may include full database backups containing sensitive data.  
This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information such as database backups, configuration files, and other data.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5) | CWE-552.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/uploads/wp-file-manager-pro/fm_backup/` and uses matchers to detect a 200 OK response containing "Index of", the backup path, and "backup_" strings indicating an exposed directory listing.
