## Vulnerability
Jenkins through 2.218, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier, is susceptible to information disclosure. An attacker can access exposed session identifiers on a user detail object in the whoAmI diagnostic page and thus potentially access sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 5.4). CWE-200.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues two identical unauthenticated GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/whoAmI/` and matches on: response headers containing both `text/html` and `x-jenkins` (case-insensitive), HTTP 200 status code, and the second response body containing both `Cookie` and `SessionId: null`. It also extracts the `x_jenkins` header value.
