## Vulnerability
The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary file deletion in versions up to, and including, 0.9.0.2 due to a lack of capability checking and insufficient path validation. This makes it possible for authenticated users with minimal permissions to delete arbitrary files from the server.

Impact: Authenticated attackers with minimal permissions can delete arbitrary files from the server, potentially breaking the WordPress installation or exposing sensitive data.

Remediation: Update WP Fastest Cache to version 0.9.0.3 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H (score: 8.1). CWE: CWE-862.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first issues a GET to `/wp-content/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/` to confirm plugin presence (status 200). It then performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` with supplied username/password credentials and verifies success via 302/200 response containing the `wordpress_logged_in` cookie. Next, it sends a POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?path=/../../../wp-content/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/languages` (target_path=languages) with `action=wpfc_delete_current_page_cache` and checks for the success message "The cache of page has been cleared" plus status 200. Finally, a GET to the same target path confirms deletion via status 404. The template is intrusive because it performs actual file-system deletion.
