## Vulnerability
GateOne 1.1 allows arbitrary file retrieval without authentication via /downloads/.. local file inclusion because os.path.join is incorrectly used.

CVSS: 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, CWE-22)

Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, remote code execution, and potential compromise of the affected system.

Remediation: Apply the latest security patches or updates provided by the vendor to mitigate the LFI vulnerability in GateOne 1.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/downloads/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd` and verifies success with combined matchers for HTTP status 200 and regex `root:.*:0:0:` present in the response body.
