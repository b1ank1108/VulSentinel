## Vulnerability
Alumni Management System 1.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability caused by unsanitized input in the admin login endpoint, letting attackers bypass authentication via injection of malicious SQL payloads. Unauthenticated attackers can gain full administrative access to the system and all alumni data.

The vulnerability has a CVSS 3.1 score of 9.8 (Critical) with vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H and is classified under CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects the vulnerability by issuing a POST request to `/admin/ajax.php?action=login` containing the SQL injection payload `username=admin'+or+'1'%3D'1'%23` (with a random password). It follows with a GET to `/admin/index.php?page=home` and confirms success if the body contains both "Welcome back Admin!" and "Alumni List", does not contain "#login-form", and returns HTTP 200.
