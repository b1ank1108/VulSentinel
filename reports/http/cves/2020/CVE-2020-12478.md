## Vulnerability
TeamPass 2.1.27.36 suffers from improper authentication (CWE-306). An unauthenticated remote attacker can retrieve files from the web root, including backups or the LDAP debug file ldap.debug.txt containing sensitive parameters. This bypasses authentication, enabling disclosure of sensitive information, data modification, and/or execution of unauthorized operations. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5 High).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass
The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/files/ldap.debug.txt` (no credentials, cookies, or login) and confirms success when the response meets all three conditions: status code 200, Content-Type header contains "text/plain", and body contains the string 'Get all LDAP params'.
