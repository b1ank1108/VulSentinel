## Vulnerability
NETGEAR routers (R6020, R6080, R6120, R6220, R6260, R6700v2, R6800, R6900v2, R7450, JNR3210, WNR2020, Nighthawk AC2100, Nighthawk AC2400) are affected by an authentication bypass (CVE-2020-27866, CWE-288, CWE-287). Network-adjacent attackers can bypass authentication to reach the administrative interface and modify network settings, intercept traffic, or escalate attacks. CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 8.8). Remediation is latest firmware from NETGEAR.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends one raw unauthenticated GET request to `/setup.cgi?todo=debug&x=currentsetting.htm` and matches HTTP 200 status plus the exact string "Debug Enable!" in the body. This confirms the protected debug/settings page is reachable without credentials.
