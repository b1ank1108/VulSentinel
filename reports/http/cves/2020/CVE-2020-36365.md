## Vulnerability

Smartstore (also known as "SmartStoreNET") versions prior to 4.1.0 contain an open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601) in multiple controller endpoints: CommonController.ClearCache, ClearDatabaseCache, RestartApplication, and ScheduleTaskController.Edit. The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft malicious URLs that redirect users to arbitrary external domains through the `previousUrl` parameter. This can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, steal sensitive information, or trick users into executing unauthorized operations on malicious sites. The vulnerability is classified as CVSS:3.1 6.1 (Medium), requiring user interaction but no authentication, with a cross-site scope affecting both confidentiality and integrity.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this open redirect vulnerability by sending a GET request to the `/backend/admin/common/clearcache` endpoint with a `previousUrl` parameter pointing to `interact.sh` (an external callback domain). The detection mechanism uses a regex matcher on the HTTP response headers to identify if the `Location` header contains a redirect to the attacker-controlled interact.sh domain. The regex pattern matches various redirect formats including absolute URLs, protocol-relative URLs, and path-based redirects that ultimately resolve to the external domain. A successful match confirms the application improperly validates the redirect destination, allowing arbitrary external redirects.
