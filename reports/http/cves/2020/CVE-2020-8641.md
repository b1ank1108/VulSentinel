## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-8641 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in Lotus Core CMS version 1.0.1. The vulnerability exists in the `index.php` file's `page_slug` parameter, which fails to properly sanitize user input. An authenticated attacker can exploit this flaw by injecting directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to navigate the filesystem and include arbitrary `.php` files. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) and has a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.8 (High severity), indicating network-based exploitation with low attack complexity requiring low-level privileges and no user interaction. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential remote code execution through PHP file inclusion, and complete system compromise.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending an HTTP GET request to the target's `index.php` endpoint with a crafted `page_slug` parameter containing a directory traversal payload: `../../../../../etc/passwd%00`. The null byte (`%00`) is used to bypass potential file extension checks. The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for two conditions: (1) the response contains a regex pattern matching typical `/etc/passwd` file entries (`root:.*:0:0:`), indicating successful file inclusion, and (2) the HTTP response status is 200. While the underlying vulnerability can potentially lead to remote code execution if PHP files are included, this detection template specifically probes for read access to sensitive system files.
