## Vulnerability
GitLab CE and EE versions 13.4 through 13.6.2 are susceptible to information disclosure via GraphQL. User email addresses are visible to unauthenticated attackers. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site.

- **CVSS Score**: 5.3
- **Vector**: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
- **CWE**: CWE-200
- **Impact**: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Remediation**: Upgrade Gitlab CE/EE to version 13.6.3 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends an unauthenticated POST request to `/api/graphql` containing a GraphQL query that retrieves `users.edges.node` fields including `username`, `email`, `avatarUrl`, and status. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 responses containing the JSON keys `"username":`, `"avatarUrl":`, and `"node":` (and condition). Emails are extracted from the response body using the JSONPath `.data.users.edges[].node.email`.
