## Vulnerability

Artica Proxy Community Edition before 4.30.000000 is vulnerable to local file inclusion via the fw.progrss.details.php popup parameter.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.

**CVSS:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5)  
**CWE:** CWE-22

**Remediation:** Upgrade to Artica Proxy Community Edition version 4.30.000000 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/fw.progrss.details.php?popup=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd` and verifies success by matching HTTP status 200 together with the regex pattern "root:[x*]:0:0" in the response body.
