severity: high
authentication: required

preconditions: authenticated user with repository creation and post-receive git hook configuration privileges (ENABLE_GIT_HOOKS enabled)

## Vulnerability
Gitea 1.1.0 through 1.12.5 is susceptible to authenticated remote code execution via the git hook functionality (post-receive hooks). An attacker with sufficient privileges can configure a malicious hook to execute arbitrary commands on the server when triggered by repository activity (CWE-78). The vendor considers this intended functionality limited to a subset of privileged accounts with clear warnings provided, though it remains exploitable in environments where such access is granted without additional restrictions. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 7.2). Impact: arbitrary code execution on the target system. Fixed in 1.16.7.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template executes a complete authenticated exploit chain to detect the vulnerability: performs login (extracting CSRF tokens), creates a new private repository, configures a post-receive git hook containing `curl {{interactsh-url}}`, creates and commits a test file to the default branch to trigger the hook, and verifies success through an out-of-band HTTP callback to the interactsh server (matcher on interactsh_protocol and body).
