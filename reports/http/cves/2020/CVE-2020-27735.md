## Vulnerability
Wing FTP 6.4.4 web interface is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS, CVE-2020-27735, CWE-79). An arbitrary IFRAME element can be injected into help pages via a crafted link, resulting in sandboxed execution of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript in the victim's browser context.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).  
Impact includes session hijacking, page defacement, or theft of sensitive information.  
Remediation requires upgrading to the latest version or applying the vendor patch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/help/english/index.html?javascript:alert(document.domain)`. Detection succeeds if the response meets all three conditions simultaneously: HTTP status 200, Content-Type header containing `text/html`, and response body containing the literal string `<frame name="hmcontent" src="javascript:alert(document.domain)" title="Content frame">`. This confirms the payload is reflected unsanitized in an IFRAME src attribute, verifying the XSS condition.
