## Vulnerability
Prometheus Blackbox Exporter through version 0.17.0 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF, CVE-2020-16248, CWE-918). The flaw is caused by an unsanitized `target` parameter in the `/probe` endpoint. 

Unauthenticated remote attackers can force the server to issue arbitrary HTTP/DNS requests to internal or external resources, enabling internal network scanning, access to restricted services, or denial-of-service. CVSS 3.1: 5.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N). Fixed in 0.17.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/probe?target={{interactsh-url}}&module=http_2xx` and confirms exploitation via a DNS interaction callback plus the presence of the string `probe_dns_lookup_time_seconds` in the response body.
