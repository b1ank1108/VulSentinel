## Vulnerability
Zoho ManageEngine OpManager Stable build before 124196 and Released build before 125125 allows an unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary files on the server by sending a specially crafted request.  
Impact: An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or further exploitation.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5) • CWE-22 Path Traversal.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends two raw HTTP requests: first a GET / to fetch the response body and internally extract the dynamic endpoint path via regex `(?m)/cachestart/.*/jquery/`, then a second GET to the constructed path-traversal payload `{{endpoint}}../../../../bin/.ssh_host_rsa_key`. It confirms successful arbitrary file read by matching HTTP status 200 on the second response AND the presence of the string "BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY" in its body (proof of reading the server's SSH host private key).
