## Vulnerability
Wireless Multiplex Terminal Playout Server <=20.2.8 exposes a default administrative account (empty username with password `pokon`) via its web administrative interface at `/server/`. 

This hard-coded credential (CWE-798) allows remote unauthenticated attackers to gain full administrative access.  
Impact: unauthorized server access.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8).  
Remediation: replace default credentials with strong, unique values.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/server/` with header `Authorization: Basic OnBva29u` (Base64-encoded `:pokon`) and confirms exploitation by matching HTTP status 200 plus the string "WMT Server" in the response body.
