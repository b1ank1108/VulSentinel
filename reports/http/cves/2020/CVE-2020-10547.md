## Vulnerability
rConfig 3.9.4 and previous versions has unauthenticated compliancepolicyelements.inc.php SQL injection. Because nodes' passwords are stored by default in cleartext, this vulnerability leads to lateral movement, granting an attacker access to monitored network devices.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/compliancepolicyelements.inc.php` injecting a UNION SELECT payload into the `searchField` parameter. The payload returns the distinctive marker string "[project-discovery]" into the result set. Confirmation occurs when this marker is present in the 200 OK response body, verifying arbitrary SQL query execution that enables unauthorized data retrieval.
