## Vulnerability
OX App Suite through 7.10.4 allows reflected cross-site scripting (XSS, CWE-79) via the app loading mechanism using the PATH_INFO to the /appsuite URI. Malicious JavaScript can be injected through unsanitized parameters.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)

Impact: Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript, potentially stealing session cookies or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of users.

Remediation: Upgrade to version 7.10.5 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/ajax/apps/manifests?action=all&format=debug&xss=<script>alert(document.domain);</script>` and confirms exploitation by matching the exact injected payload `<script>alert(document.domain);</script>` and the string `Request with action all` in the response body, `text/html` in the Content-Type header, and HTTP 200 status code.
