## Vulnerability
Oracle WebLogic Server is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) in the administration console. The flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands by sending a specially crafted request to `/console/css/%252e%252e%252fconsole.portal` that exploits path traversal combined with MVEL2 expression evaluation. Affected versions are 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, 12.2.1.3.0, 12.2.1.4.0, and 14.1.1.0.0. Successful exploitation grants command execution with WebLogic server privileges (execute malware, obtain sensitive information, modify data, gain full control). Related to CVE-2020-14882.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs active exploitation by issuing a POST request embedding a malicious Java/MVEL payload that retrieves the `cmd` header value (set to `curl {{interactsh-url}}`), executes it via `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`, and streams the output back. Detection confirms success via DNS interaction on interactsh, presence of `ADMINCONSOLESESSION=` in response headers, and matching HTML body structure.
