## Vulnerability
Media Library Assistant plugin for WordPress before 2.82 contains a local file inclusion caused by unsanitized mla_gallery link parameter, letting attackers include arbitrary local files. Exploit requires access to the vulnerable link. Impact: attackers can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to information disclosure or code execution. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues unauthenticated GET requests to `wp-content/plugins/media-library-assistant/includes/mla-file-downloader.php` with `mla_download_type=text/html` and `mla_download_file` set to known local paths (`/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-content/index.php` or `/var/www/html/wp-content/index.php`). It verifies success when `status_code == 200` and the response body contains the string `// Silence is golden.` (the standard WordPress index.php comment).
