## Vulnerability
Z-Blog <=1.5.2 contains an open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601) via the `redirect` parameter in `zb_system/cmd.php`. An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious site and possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations. Impact includes phishing attacks or chained exploits. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1). Remediation: upgrade to version 1.5.3 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template first sends a POST to `/zb_system/cmd.php?act=verify` with form data containing `username`, `password` (MD5-hashed), and login fields to establish an authenticated session. It then issues a GET to `/zb_system/cmd.php?atc=login&redirect=http://www.interact.sh` and matches the `Location` response header with a regex to confirm unsanitized reflection of the external interact.sh domain.
