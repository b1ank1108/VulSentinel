## Vulnerability
MobileIron Core & Connector (versions 10.3.0.3 and earlier, 10.4.0.0–10.6.0.0) and Sentry (versions 9.7.2 and earlier, 9.8.0), along with Monitor and Reporting Database (RDB) ≤2.0.0.1, contain a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2020-15505, CVSS 9.8) allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via Hessian protocol vectors on the LogService endpoint.  
Impact: Successful exploitation can lead to full compromise of the MobileIron infrastructure.  
Remediation: Upgrade Core & Connector beyond v10.6 and Sentry beyond v9.8.  
This template is detection-only; full exploitation requires the Hessian deserialization chain detailed in references.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues an unauthenticated POST request to `/mifs/.;/services/LogService` with `Content-Type: x-application/hessian` and a minimal binary Hessian header payload (`hex_decode('630200480004')`). It detects the vulnerability by checking for `application/x-hessian` in the response `Content-Type` header combined with HTTP 200 status code. Non-vulnerable instances return 403 or 500.
