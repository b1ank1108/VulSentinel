affected_product: Grav
severity: medium

preconditions: []

## Vulnerability
Grav before 1.7 contains an open redirect in common/Grav.php (CWE-601). The flaw permits unauthenticated attackers to supply arbitrary URLs that are reflected into the Location header, redirecting users to malicious domains for phishing. Issue was partially addressed in 1.6.23 yet remains exploitable across the entire 1.6.x branch.  
CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).  
No authentication or additional configuration required.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only  
The template sends one GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/%252f%255cinteract.sh%252fa%253fb/` and applies a regex matcher on the Location response header to confirm whether the server performs an open redirect to the interact.sh domain.
