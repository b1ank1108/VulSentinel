## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-36333 is a critical authentication bypass and database reset vulnerability in the ThemeGrill Demo Importer WordPress plugin. Versions 1.3.4 through 1.6.1 contain a flaw in the `reset_wizard_actions` hook that does not require authentication for wiping the database. Any unauthenticated attacker can trigger a complete database reset to its default state, after which they are automatically logged in as an administrator. This results in complete site takeover, total data loss, and unauthorized administrative access. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) with a CVSS score of 9.1.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: state-change

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated GET request to `/wp-admin/admin-post.php?do_reset_wordpress=1`. This endpoint triggers the database reset action without requiring any authentication credentials. The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for three conditions:

1. An empty response body (length of 0)
2. HTTP 302 redirect status code
3. Response headers containing both `wordpress_logged_in_` (indicating an active WordPress session cookie) and `reset=true` (confirming the reset action completed)

The presence of the `wordpress_logged_in_` cookie in the response demonstrates that the attacker has been automatically authenticated as an administrator following the database wipe.
