## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-7136 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in HPE Smart Update Manager (SUM) versions prior to 8.5.6. The vulnerability allows remote unauthorized access without valid credentials, classified as CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel). With a CVSS score of 9.8, this flaw enables attackers to gain complete unauthorized access to the management interface, potentially leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability has an EPSS score of 0.73061 (98.757th percentile), indicating a high probability of exploitation in the wild.

The flaw permits attackers to create authenticated sessions by exploiting improper authentication validation when SSH key authentication parameters are provided, regardless of whether the credentials or keys are valid.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects this authentication bypass vulnerability through a two-step process:

1. **Session Creation with Invalid Credentials**: Sends a POST request to `/session/create` with a JSON payload containing arbitrary/invalid credentials (`"password":"any_password"`), SSH key parameters (`"usesshkey":true`), and invalid SSH key material (`"privatekey":"any_privateky"`, `"passphrase":"any_passphase"`). Despite the invalid authentication data, the vulnerable system creates a valid session.

2. **Session Validation**: Extracts the `sessionId` from the response and uses it in a subsequent GET request to `/session/{{sessionid}}/node/index` to verify that the created session grants authenticated access to management functions.

The template confirms successful exploitation by checking for three indicators in the response body: "hmessage", "Command completed successfully", and "node_name", which indicate successful authenticated access to node management functionality.
