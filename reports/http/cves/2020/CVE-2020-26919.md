## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-26919 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability affecting NETGEAR ProSAFE Plus devices running firmware versions prior to 2.6.0.43. The vulnerability stems from missing function-level access control on publicly accessible HTML pages, specifically the login.html webpage. Any HTML page on the device accepts POST requests with debug actions via the `submitId` and `debugCmd` parameters without requiring authentication. Since the login page must be publicly accessible for legitimate login operations, it inadvertently exposes debug functionality that allows arbitrary system command execution. This architectural flaw enables remote attackers to execute commands on the affected device without any credentials, leading to complete system compromise.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated POST request to `/login.htm` with debug parameters. It submits `submitId=debug` along with a `debugCmd` parameter containing a `wget` command that attempts to contact an attacker-controlled server (using Interactsh callback URL). The template verifies successful exploitation by confirming that the vulnerable device makes an HTTP callback to the Interactsh server, proving that the injected command was executed by the system. This demonstrates that the device processes debug commands without authentication and executes arbitrary system commands specified in the `debugCmd` parameter.
