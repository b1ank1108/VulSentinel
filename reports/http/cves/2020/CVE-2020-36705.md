## Vulnerability
The Adning Advertising plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the _ning_upload_image function in versions up to and including 1.5.5. Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files to the server, which may enable remote code execution and full compromise of the WordPress site and underlying server. Impact includes potential complete system takeover. CVSS 3.1: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Fixed in 1.5.6.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs passive version fingerprinting by issuing a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/`. It extracts the version string via regex `(?i)Ads on this site are served by Adning v([0-9.]+)` from the response body and applies DSL matchers requiring status_code == 200, contains_all(body, 'served by Adning', 'adning.com'), and compare_versions(version, '< 1.5.6').
