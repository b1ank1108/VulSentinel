## Vulnerability
WordPress wpCentral plugin before 1.5.1 suffers from information disclosure (CVE-2020-9043, CWE-200). An attacker can access the wpCentral Connection Key for the WordPress Admin account, potentially obtaining sensitive information, modifying data, or performing unauthorized operations.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 8.8)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a multi-step authenticated flow: POST login to /wp-login.php with supplied username/password, GET /wp-admin/index.php, GET logout to /wp-login.php using extracted nonce, then GET /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=my_wpc_signon&auth_key={{authkey}} (authkey and nonce extracted via internal regex on prior responses). It verifies the flaw if response 4 returns status 200, text/html content-type, contains "wpCentral Connection Key", and dashboard page indicators.
