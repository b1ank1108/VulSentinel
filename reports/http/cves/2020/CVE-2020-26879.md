## Vulnerability
Ruckus vRioT IoT Controller through 1.5.1.0.21 contains a hardcoded authentication token in `validate_token.py`. This API backdoor (CWE-798) permits unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass all authentication checks and interact freely with the administrative API.  
Impact: full control over the controller and all connected IoT devices (CVSS 3.1 score 9.8, vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Remediation: upgrade to 1.5.1.0.22 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template issues a single raw POST request to `/service/v1/createUser` supplying the hardcoded `Authorization: OlDkR+oocZg=` header together with randomly generated username/password JSON. It then verifies success by requiring both HTTP 200 and the substrings `{"ok": 1}` and `{"message":` in the response body while rejecting the string `Invalid JSON`. A positive match confirms the backdoor token is accepted and the API executes the user-creation action without any prior login.
