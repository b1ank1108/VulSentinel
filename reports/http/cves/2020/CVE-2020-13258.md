## Vulnerability
Contentful for Python (the-example-app.py) through 2020-05-21 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability via the api parameter. An unauthenticated remote attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when visited by a victim, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context. This can result in session hijacking, page defacement, or theft of sensitive information. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends one raw GET request to `/?cda'"</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>&locale=locale=de-DE` and verifies the condition by matching for the exact unsanitized payload reflected inside a JSON-like structure `{'api': '[payload]'}` in the body, combined with `text/html` in the Content-Type header and HTTP status 200.
