## Vulnerability

Spring Cloud Config Server versions 2.2.x prior to 2.2.3, versions 2.1.x prior to 2.1.9, and older unsupported versions allow applications to serve arbitrary configuration files through the spring-cloud-config-server module. A malicious user or attacker can send a request using a specially crafted URL that can lead to a local file inclusion attack. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or sensitive information disclosure.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5)  
CWE: CWE-23, CWE-22  
CPE: cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_cloud_config:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252Fetc%252Fpasswd%23foo/development` (heavy double-encoded path traversal targeting /etc/passwd) and verifies success with an HTTP 200 status code plus a regex match for `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body.
