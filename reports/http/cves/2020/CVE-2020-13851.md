## Vulnerability
Artica Pandora FMS 7.44 allows remote command execution via the events feature. Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary system commands via the events feature, leading to complete server compromise and access to all monitoring data.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 8.8), CWE-78.

Remediation: Upgrade to Pandora FMS version 7.45 or later, or apply vendor-provided security patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/pandora_console/ajax.php?page=include/ajax/events&perform_event_response=10000000&target=cat+/etc/passwd&response_id=1` (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded) that injects the OS command `cat /etc/passwd` through the `target` parameter. Detection succeeds if the response satisfies all three matchers simultaneously: body contains `root:.*:0:0:` (confirming command output), headers contain both `text/html` and `PHPSESSID=`, and HTTP status is 200.
