## Vulnerability
Mitel ShoreTel 19.46.1802.0 devices and their conference component are vulnerable to unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via the PATH_INFO variable passed to index.php. This stems from insufficient validation and sanitization of the time_zone object on the HOME_MEETING page.

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser context, potentially resulting in session hijacking, page defacement, or sensitive information theft.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template uses a multi-request flow. It first fingerprints the target by requesting the base URL or /server-common/cgi-bin/login and matching for "Mitel Networks Corporation" or "ShoreTel" (case-insensitive) in the response body. The exploit request injects the payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` directly into the PATH_INFO of `/index.php/... ?page=HOME`. Detection confirms success if the raw script tag is reflected back in the HTML body, content-type is text/html, and HTTP status is 200.
