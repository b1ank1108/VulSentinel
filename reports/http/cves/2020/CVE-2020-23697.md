## Vulnerability
Monstra CMS 3.0.4 contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the page creation feature at `admin/index.php?id=pages&action=add_page`. Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript via the `page_title` parameter; the payload is persisted unsanitized and executes in the browser context of any user visiting the resulting page. Impact includes cookie theft, session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.  
CVSS v3.1: 5.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first POSTs credentials to `/admin/index.php?id=dashboard` to authenticate, then GETs the add-page form to extract the CSRF token via regex, POSTs a new page using a random lowercase page_name and a `page_title` payload of `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`, and finally GETs the newly created page URL. It confirms the vulnerability if the final response body contains the unescaped `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` string together with the "Monstra" identifier and valid HTML content.
