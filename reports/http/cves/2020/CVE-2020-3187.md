## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-3187 is a critical directory traversal vulnerability affecting Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain read and delete access to sensitive files on the targeted system. This path traversal flaw (CWE-22) enables arbitrary file access without requiring authentication, potentially exposing sensitive configuration data, credentials, or other critical system information. The CVSS v3.1 score of 9.1 (Critical) reflects the high confidentiality and integrity impact, with network-based attack vector requiring no privileges or user interaction.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects the presence of this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the path `/+CSCOE+/session_password.html` on the target system. The detection logic verifies two conditions:

1. The HTTP response headers contain the string "webvpn" or "Webvpn" (case-insensitive)
2. The server returns a 200 OK status code

This probe targets a specific WebVPN-related endpoint that should not be accessible without proper authentication. A successful response with the webvpn header indicates the system is vulnerable to the directory traversal attack, as it demonstrates unauthorized access to a sensitive file path. The template itself performs a read-only detection operation, though the underlying vulnerability permits both read and delete operations on arbitrary files.
