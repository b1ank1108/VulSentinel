## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-10220 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in rConfig through version 3.9.4. The web interface is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `searchColumn` parameter in the `commands.inc.php` file. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the backend database. The flaw is classified as CWE-89 (SQL Injection) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8, indicating critical severity. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data leakage, and potentially complete compromise of the application and underlying database.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a crafted GET request to `/commands.inc.php` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `searchColumn` parameter. The payload uses a UNION-based SQL injection technique to extract data from the database. Specifically, it injects:

```
command UNION ALL SELECT (SELECT CONCAT(0x223E3C42523E5B50574E5D,md5('999999999'),0x5B50574E5D3C42523E) limit 0,1),NULL--
```

This payload attempts to concatenate a unique marker string with the MD5 hash of a random number (999999999). The template verifies successful exploitation by checking if the response body contains the MD5 hash of the injected number and returns an HTTP 200 status code. The presence of the computed MD5 hash in the response confirms that the SQL injection was successful and the application is vulnerable to arbitrary SQL query execution.
