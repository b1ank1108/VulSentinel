## Vulnerability
An issue was discovered in the "Ultimate Addons for Elementor" plugin before 1.24.2 for WordPress, as exploited in the wild in May 2020 in conjunction with CVE-2020-13126. Unauthenticated attackers can create users with the Subscriber role even if registration is disabled. Impact: unauthenticated attackers can create user accounts with Subscriber role, potentially leading to further malicious activities or privilege escalation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` (with redirects) and parses the response body with regex matchers for `uaelRegistration` and `form_nonce` strings, plus `post_id` and `widgets_id` patterns, to locate any active UAEL registration form. It then iterates over discovered widget IDs and sends a raw POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` containing `action=uael_register_user`, the extracted nonce/post/widget values, and randomized user credentials (`username`, `email`, `password`, `first_name`, `last_name`). Detection succeeds when the JSON response contains the string "successfully registered", has `application/json` content-type, and returns HTTP 200.
