## Vulnerability
WAVLINK routers (models WN530HG4, WN531G3, WN533A8, WN551K) suffer from improper access control (CWE-306). An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve the full device configuration backup—including the administrator password—via a direct request to the backup endpoint. The returned file is encrypted in standard OpenSSL 'Salted__' format, with all decryption details publicly documented. 

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5 High).  
Impact: full exposure of sensitive configuration and credentials, enabling subsequent device takeover.  
Remediation: apply latest vendor firmware.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues an unauthenticated GET request to `/backupsettings.dat` and verifies exposure by matching HTTP 200 status, `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` header, and the literal string `Salted__` anywhere in the response body (signature of the encrypted settings backup).
