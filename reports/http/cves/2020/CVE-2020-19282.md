## Vulnerability

Jeesns 1.4.2 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting that allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload in the system error message's text field.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

Remediation: Upgrade to the latest version of Jeesns or apply the vendor-provided patch to fix the XSS vulnerability.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `/error?msg=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` and matches for the unescaped payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` appearing in the response body (plus `text/html` Content-Type header and HTTP 200 status) to confirm lack of sanitization on the `msg` parameter.
