[Agent 2][AgentThink] Extracted signals for CVE-2020-7318 template:
- affected_product: McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (from info.name stripping the CVE and description part)
- severity: medium (direct from info.severity)
- authentication: required (description mentions "allows administrators to inject", CVSS PR:H, endpoint is admin PolicyMgmt panel even if template request doesn't include creds)
- external_callback: false (no interactsh or OOB, just reflection check)
- affected_versions: before 5.10.9 Update 9 (direct from info.name and description)
- preconditions: administrator privileges required (from description "allows administrators to inject" and PR:H)

For PoC classification: I think info-leak because XSS enables reading browser context data (cookies, DOM) and exfil, though it's client-side. Not rce, not dos, not state-change directly. Not detect-only as it probes the actual sanitization flaw.
[Agent 2][AgentThink] Full suggested Markdown output:



## Vulnerability

McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator before 5.10.9 Update 9 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS, CVE-2020-7318, CWE-79). The flaw allows administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via multiple unsanitized parameters.

CVSS v3.1: AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (4.3/medium)

Successful exploitation permits arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of an administrator's browser.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to the `/PolicyMgmt/policyDetailsCard.do` endpoint with an XSS payload injected into the `prodID` query parameter (`'><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`). Detection succeeds if the HTTP response is status 200, contains `text/html` in headers, and the response body reflects both "Policy Name" and the unsanitized payload string, confirming the reflection vulnerability.

Classification as info-leak due to XSS enabling potential data exfiltration (e.g. session cookies) from browser context. All info sourced strictly from YAML. Ready for final.
[Agent 2][AgentThink] No further changes needed. The YAML has no compare_versions or DSL for exact range beyond the stated "before 5.10.9 Update 9". Template has no auth in requests but vuln requires it per metadata and desc. XSS classification as info-leak aligns with data exfil potential and available categories.
[Agent 3][AgentThink] I have analyzed the template for CVE-2020-7318. It's a reflected XSS in McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator. 

Signals draft:
- affected_product: McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator
- severity: medium
- authentication: required (admin context, CVSS PR:H)
- external_callback: false (no OOB)
- affected_versions: before 5.10.9 Update 9
- preconditions: [] (no additional config features mentioned beyond auth/version)

For PoC classification: I chose 'info-leak' as XSS allows potential data exfiltration/reading in browser context (e.g. session tokens). Alternatives could be state-change due to unauthorized actions, but info-leak fits the examples best among options.

Vuln section: summarize description as reflected XSS via unsanitized params for admins.

PoC: describe the GET request with payload and matchers for reflection.

References: all listed URLs.

Any adjustments before I finalize?
[Agent 3][AgentThink] Here is the complete report draft based on strict instructions:



## Vulnerability
McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator before 5.10.9 Update 9 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS). The issue allows injection of arbitrary web script or HTML via multiple unsanitized parameters (demonstrated in `policyDetailsCard.do?prodID`) due to improper sanitization of administrator-provided inputs.

Classification CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 4.3). Successful exploitation permits arbitrary script execution in the victim's browser, enabling session hijacking or unauthorized actions.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw GET request to `/PolicyMgmt/policyDetailsCard.do?poID=19&typeID=3&prodID=%27%22%3E%3Csvg%2fonload%3dalert(document.domain)%3E` and checks for successful reflection. Matchers confirm: 200 OK status, text/html content-type, "Policy Name" string in body, and unsanitized payload reflected in response body. This verifies the reflected XSS condition without performing full exploitation.

This follows all rules: signals first, exact sections, only template data, no YAML dump, no top #, etc. Ready for submission?
[Agent 1][AgentThink] I have analyzed the YAML for CVE-2020-7318. It's a reflected XSS in McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator.
[Agent 3][AgentThink] One adjustment: the yaml has 'reference:' inside description and separate, but for References section use all unique URLs from info.reference fields as instructed. Draft looks complete and information-dense. No guesses made - all extracted directly.
[Agent 1][AgentThink] Signals draft:
- affected_product: McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator
- severity: medium
- authentication: none (reflected XSS, attacker crafts link, no creds in template request)
- external_callback: false (no interactsh or OOB)
- affected_versions: before 5.10.9 Update 9
- preconditions: requires logged-in administrator to visit crafted malicious URL

Vuln is reflected XSS via prodID param. Classification for PoC: I suggest "state-change" as it enables unauthorized actions via JS in admin context. Or "info-leak" for potential data exfil. I lean state-change per impact desc.

Template does reflected payload check with alert(document.domain) and matches on body reflection + "Policy Name".

For ## Vulnerability section: summarize desc, impact, CVSS from classification field.

Let me know what you think or if need changes.
[Agent 1][AgentThink] Here's the full recommended output:



## Vulnerability

McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator before 5.10.9 Update 9 is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Administrators can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via multiple parameters (demonstrated in prodID of policyDetailsCard.do) as entries are not correctly sanitized.

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score: 4.3). CWE-79.

Impact includes arbitrary script execution in the administrator's browser, enabling session hijacking or unauthorized actions.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template sends a GET request with an XSS payload (`'"><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`) in the prodID query parameter to /PolicyMgmt/policyDetailsCard.do and matches on status 200, text/html Content-Type header, presence of "Policy Name" in body, and reflection of the unsanitized payload string to detect the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability
McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator before 5.10.9 Update 9 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS, CVE-2020-7318, CWE-79). Administrators can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via multiple unsanitized parameters (e.g. prodID in policyDetailsCard.do).

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 4.3).  
Successful exploitation allows arbitrary script execution in the targeted administrator's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or unauthorized actions. Remediation requires upgrade to 5.10.9 Update 9 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues one raw GET request to `/PolicyMgmt/policyDetailsCard.do?poID=19&typeID=3&prodID=%27%22%3E%3Csvg%2fonload%3dalert(document.domain)%3E`, then matches on status 200, text/html Content-Type header, presence of "Policy Name" in body, and reflection of the exact unsanitized payload string to confirm the flaw.
