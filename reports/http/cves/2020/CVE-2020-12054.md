## Vulnerability
WordPress Catch Breadcrumb plugin before 1.5.4 is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the `s` search query parameter. 16 themes are also affected if the plugin is enabled: Alchemist and Alchemist PRO, Izabel and Izabel PRO, Chique and Chique PRO, Clean Enterprise and Clean Enterprise PRO, Bold Photography PRO, Intuitive PRO, Devotepress PRO, Clean Blocks PRO, Foodoholic PRO, Catch Mag PRO, Catch Wedding PRO, and Higher Education PRO.

CVSS 6.1 (Medium): AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N. Exploitation can lead to malicious script injection, data theft, session hijacking, or site defacement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/?s=%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert%28123%29%3B%3E` and matches for the unsanitized payload reflected in the response body (along with "catch-breadcrumb" string), text/html content-type, and status 200 to confirm the reflected XSS.
