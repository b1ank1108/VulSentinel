## Vulnerability
WordPress PayPal Pro plugin before 1.1.65 is susceptible to SQL injection via the 'query' parameter which allows for any unauthenticated user to perform SQL queries with the results output to a web page in JSON format.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8, CWE-89).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/?cffaction=get_data_from_database&query=SELECT%20*%20from%20wp_users` and matches on HTTP status 200, Content-Type header containing "text/html", and response body containing all of `"user_login"`, `"user_email"`, `"user_pass"`, `"user_activation_key"` (AND condition). This verifies the SQL injection by executing a SELECT against the wp_users table and confirming the leaked sensitive fields are returned in JSON.
