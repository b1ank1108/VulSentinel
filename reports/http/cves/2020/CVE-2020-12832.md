## Vulnerability
The WordPress Simple File List plugin is affected by a path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in the file upload handler. The `eeSFL_FileUploadDir` parameter in the `sfl_upload_job` AJAX action can be set to values containing `../` sequences, allowing uploaded files to be written outside the intended `wp-content/uploads/simple-file-list/` subdirectory.

**CVSS**: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**Impact**: Attackers can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially causing data loss or service disruption.  
**Remediation**: Update to version 4.2.8 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template actively verifies the vulnerability through a multi-step unauthenticated workflow:  
1. Queries the public WordPress REST API endpoint `/?rest_route=/wp/v2/pages&per_page=100` to locate any page embedding the plugin's upload interface (contains "eeSFL_UploadGo").  
2. Visits the discovered page slug and extracts the upload nonce (`ee-simple-file-list-upload-nonce`), list ID (`eeSFL_ID`), and allowed file extension via regex.  
3. Issues a multipart/form-data POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` (action=`sfl_upload_job`) containing a test file named `{{rand}}.{{ext}}` and sets `eeSFL_FileUploadDir=wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsimple-file-list%2F..%2F`.  
4. Performs a final GET to `/wp-content/uploads/{{rand}}.{{ext}}` and confirms the response status is 200 and body contains the random test payload.

This proves the traversal succeeds and permits unauthorized file writes outside the restricted upload path.
