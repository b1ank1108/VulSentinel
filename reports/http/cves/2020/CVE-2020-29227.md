## Vulnerability
Car Rental Management System 1.0 suffers from a critical unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. The flaw exists in the `/index.php` endpoint where the `page` parameter accepts a partial filename, allowing file inclusion attacks via null byte poisoning (`%00`).

An attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server. While primarily enabling sensitive file reads (e.g., configuration files, source code), the description indicates this can lead to code execution.

CVSS Score: 9.8  
Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  
Impact: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure.  
Remediation: Apply the latest patch or update provided by the vendor to fix the LFI vulnerability in the Car Rental Management System 1.0.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The detection template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?page=/etc/passwd%00` and matches on status code 200 combined with regex "root:.*:0:0:" in the response body to confirm LFI success and exposure of system user data.
