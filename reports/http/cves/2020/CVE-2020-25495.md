## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-25495 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Xinuo (formerly SCO) Openserver versions 5 and 6. The vulnerability exists in the `/cgi-bin/manlist` CGI script, which fails to properly sanitize the `section` parameter before reflecting it in the HTTP response. Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML tags through this parameter, leading to reflected XSS attacks. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). The attack vector is network-based, requires low attack complexity, no privileges, but does require user interaction. The scope is changed, with low impact to confidentiality and integrity, but no impact to availability.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to `/cgi-bin/manlist` with a crafted `section` parameter containing an XSS payload: `"><h1>hello</h1><script>alert(/{{randstr}}/)</script>`. The detection verifies successful exploitation by checking for three conditions: (1) the injected HTML/JavaScript payload (`<h1>hello</h1><script>alert(/{{randstr}}/)</script>`) is reflected in the response body, (2) the response Content-Type header is `text/html`, and (3) the HTTP status code is 200. The template uses a random string (`{{randstr}}`) to ensure uniqueness and avoid false positives. This is an intrusive test that actually injects executable JavaScript into the response, though the payload itself is benign (alert box).
