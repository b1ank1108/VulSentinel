## Vulnerability
WordPress Canto plugin 1.3.0 is vulnerable to blind server-side request forgery (SSRF, CWE-918). The flaw exists in the unsanitized `subdomain` parameter accepted by `/wp-content/plugins/canto/includes/lib/detail.php`, `get.php`, and `tree.php`. An unauthenticated remote attacker can force the server to issue arbitrary HTTP requests to internal or external targets, enabling reconnaissance, internal data access, or chained attacks against backend services.  
CVSS: 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). Successful exploitation could result in unauthorized access to sensitive internal resources and potential data leakage. Fixed in 1.3.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template first issues an internal GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/canto/readme.txt` and confirms the Canto plugin is present via the words "Canto" and "Tested up to:". It then sends GET requests to the three vulnerable endpoints with `subdomain={{interactsh-url}}` (stopping at the first match). Detection relies on an out-of-band HTTP callback to interactsh plus response matchers requiring status 200, `application/json` Content-Type header, and the string "null" in the body.
