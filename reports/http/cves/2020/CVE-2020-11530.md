## Vulnerability

WordPress Chop Slider 3 plugin contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `get_script/index.php` file via the `id` GET parameter. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries in the context of the WordPress database user. The flaw stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data before using it in SQL queries (CWE-89).

Successful exploitation enables attackers to:
- Extract sensitive information from the database (usernames, password hashes, email addresses, etc.)
- Modify database contents
- Execute unauthorized administrative operations within the affected WordPress site
- Potentially escalate privileges or compromise the entire WordPress installation

The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 (Critical) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating network-based exploitation requiring no privileges or user interaction, with high impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The EPSS score of 0.93134 (99.787th percentile) indicates a very high probability of active exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs a time-based blind SQL injection detection by sending a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/chopslider/get_script/index.php` with a malicious `id` parameter containing a SQL SLEEP payload: `1+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(6)))A)`. 

The detection logic verifies the vulnerability by checking four conditions:
1. Response time is 6 seconds or greater (indicating the SLEEP command executed)
2. HTTP status code is 200
3. Content-Type header contains "application/javascript"
4. Response body contains the string "$(document).ready(function()" (confirming the expected script output)

The template uses a 10-second timeout to accommodate the 6-second sleep delay. This time-based approach confirms the SQL injection vulnerability without extracting actual data, though the underlying vulnerability allows full database access and data exfiltration.
