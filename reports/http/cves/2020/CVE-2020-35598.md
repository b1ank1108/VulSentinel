## Vulnerability
ACS Advanced Comment System 1.0 is affected by local file inclusion via an advanced_component_system/index.php?ACS_path=..%2f URI. The ACS_path parameter is vulnerable to path traversal using repeated `..%2f` sequences terminated by a null byte (`%00`), allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to include and read arbitrary files from the server filesystem (e.g., /etc/passwd). CWE-22. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, remote code execution, and potential compromise of the entire system.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/advanced_component_system/index.php?ACS_path=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd%00` and verifies success by matching HTTP status 200 together with the regex `root:.*:0:0:` (indicating successful inclusion of /etc/passwd).
