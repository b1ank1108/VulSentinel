## Vulnerability
Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x has incorrect access control for admingui/version URIs in the Administration console, as demonstrated by unauthenticated read access to encryption keys. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the affected system. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). CWE-306.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass
The template issues two unauthenticated GET requests to `/admingui/version/serverTasksGeneral?serverTasksGeneral.GeneralWebserverTabs.TabHref=2` and `/admingui/version/serverConfigurationsGeneral?serverConfigurationsGeneral.GeneralWebserverTabs.TabHref=4`. It detects the vulnerability by confirming HTTP 200 responses that contain the string "Admin Console" and at least one of "serverConfigurationsGeneral" or "serverCertificatesGeneral".
