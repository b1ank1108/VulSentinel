## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-11710 is a critical security misconfiguration in Kong Admin through version 2.0.3 when deployed via docker-kong. The vulnerability exposes the Kong Admin API port on network interfaces other than the intended localhost (127.0.0.1) binding. This misconfiguration allows remote attackers on the network to access the administrative API without any authentication requirements, effectively granting unauthorized administrative control over the Kong API gateway. The issue stems from improper network binding configuration in the docker-kong deployment, making what should be a localhost-only administrative interface accessible from external networks.

The CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical) reflects the severity of exposing administrative functionality without authentication, enabling complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Kong gateway.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects this vulnerability by attempting to access the Kong Admin API endpoints directly without authentication. It sends GET requests to two paths:
1. The base URL (`{{BaseURL}}`)
2. The admin endpoint (`{{BaseURL}}/admin/`)

The detection logic verifies successful unauthorized access by checking for:
- HTTP 200 status code response
- Presence of three specific strings in the response body: 'Welcome to kong', 'configuration', and 'kong_env'

All three body conditions must be met simultaneously along with the 200 status code. The presence of these strings indicates the Admin API welcome page is accessible, confirming that the administrative interface is exposed without proper access controls. This detection method identifies instances where the admin API is reachable from external networks rather than being restricted to localhost as intended.
