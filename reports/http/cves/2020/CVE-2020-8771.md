## Vulnerability
WordPress Time Capsule plugin before 1.21.16 contains an authentication bypass (CWE-287). Any HTTP request containing the literal string `IWP_JSON_PREFIX` (typically in POST body) forces the server to authenticate the client as the first administrator account in the WordPress users table.  
CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Impact: full unauthorized admin access to the plugin and WordPress backend.  
Remediation: update to 1.21.16 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template executes a two-request detection sequence:  
1. POST `/` with body containing only `IWP_JSON_PREFIX` (no credentials or cookies).  
2. GET `/wp-admin/index.php`.  
Success is confirmed if the second response returns status 200, Content-Type `text/html`, and contains both `<div id="adminmenumain" role="navigation" aria-label="Main menu">` and `<h1>Dashboard</h1>` in the body. The template also extracts any `wordpress_[a-z0-9]+` authentication cookies from response headers.
