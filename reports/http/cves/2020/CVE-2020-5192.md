## Vulnerability
Hospital Management System 4.0 by phpgurukul contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. Multiple pages and parameters fail to validate user input, allowing an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. Impacts include extraction of sensitive database information, data modification, and unauthorized administrative operations. (CWE-89; CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H - 8.8)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template first authenticates via POST to `/hospital/hms/doctor/index.php` supplying `username` and `password` form values. It then sends a second POST to `/hospital/hms/doctor/search.php` with a UNION ALL SELECT payload in the `searchdata` parameter: `'+UNION+ALL+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(CONCAT(md5(999999999),1),2),NULL--+PqeG`. Success is confirmed if the rendered MD5 hash appears in the 200 OK response body.
