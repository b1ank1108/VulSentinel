## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-13700 is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the WordPress acf-to-rest-api plugin through version 3.1.0. The vulnerability allows unauthorized attackers to manipulate permalinks and access sensitive information from the wp_options table through the plugin's REST API endpoint. Specifically, attackers can retrieve sensitive data such as login credentials and password values by crafting requests to the `/wp-json/acf/v3/options/` endpoint. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) and has a CVSS score of 7.5, indicating high severity with network-based attack vector, low attack complexity, and no authentication required.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the endpoint `/wp-json/acf/v3/options/a?id=active&field=plugins`. This request attempts to access the WordPress options table through the vulnerable REST API endpoint. The template verifies the vulnerability by checking for three conditions:

1. The response contains a JSON content-type header
2. The response body includes the string 'acf-to-rest-api/class-acf-to-rest-api.php', confirming the plugin is installed and the endpoint is exposing internal data
3. The HTTP status code is 200, indicating successful access

The detection confirms that the REST API endpoint is improperly exposing sensitive WordPress configuration data without proper authorization checks.
