## Vulnerability
rConfig prior to version 3.9.4 is susceptible to sensitive information disclosure. An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve saved cleartext credentials via a GET request to settings.php. Because the application does not exit after a redirect is applied, the rest of the page still executes, resulting in the disclosure of cleartext credentials in the response. Impact includes exposure of usernames and passwords (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, score 7.5).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/settings.php` and confirms exposure if the response body contains both the strings `defaultNodeUsername` and `defaultNodePassword` (AND condition) with HTTP status 200.
