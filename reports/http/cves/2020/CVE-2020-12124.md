## Vulnerability
A remote command-line injection vulnerability in the `/cgi-bin/live_api.cgi` endpoint of the WAVLINK WN530H4 M30H4.V5030.190403 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Linux commands as root without authentication. Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary Linux commands as root on the WAVLINK WN530H4 device, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or using the device as a pivot point for further attacks. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8), CWE-78.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template sends a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/cgi-bin/live_api.cgi?page={{rand_base(3)}}&id={{rand_int(1, 10)}}&ip=;id;` (randomized page/id values) and verifies exploitation success via an AND matcher: regex match on body for `((u|g)id|groups)=[0-9]{1,4}\([a-z0-9]+\)`, presence of the word "WiFiBand", and HTTP 200 status.
