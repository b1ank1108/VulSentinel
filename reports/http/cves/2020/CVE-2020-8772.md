## Vulnerability
WordPress InfiniteWP plugin before 1.9.4.5 for WordPress contains an authorization bypass vulnerability via a missing authorization check in iwp_mmb_set_request in init.php (CWE-862). An attacker who knows the username of an administrator can log in as that administrator, obtaining sensitive information, modifying data, and/or executing unauthorized operations. An attacker can gain unauthorized administrative access to the WordPress site. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects the vulnerability via two raw HTTP requests. First, a GET to `/?author=1` extracts an administrator username via regex from the response body (Author span tag) or Location header. Second, a POST to `/` submits `_IWP_JSON_PREFIX_` followed by base64-encoded JSON `{"iwp_action":"add_site","params":{"username":"[extracted_username]"}}`. Success is confirmed by matching `wordpress_logged_in` in response headers, `<IWPHEADER>` in body, and HTTP 200 status.
