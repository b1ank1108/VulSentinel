## Vulnerability
CSE Bookstore 1.0 is vulnerable to time-based blind, boolean-based blind, and OR error-based SQL injection via the `pubid` parameter in `bookPerPub.php`. Unauthenticated remote attackers can exploit this to dump the entire database, including sensitive student and administrative data. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request (`GET /ebook/bookPerPub.php?pubid=4'`) and matches the response body for SQL syntax error strings ("get book price failed! You have an error in your SQL syntax" or "Can't retrieve data You have an error in your SQL syntax") using an OR condition to confirm the injectable parameter.
