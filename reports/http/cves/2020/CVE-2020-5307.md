## Vulnerability
PHPGurukul Dairy Farm Shop Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection (CWE-89) via the `username` parameter in `index.php` (login form), as well as `category`/`CategoryCode` in `add-category.php`, `CompanyName` in `add-company.php`, and `ProductName`/`ProductPrice` in `add-product.php`. Unauthenticated remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries. CVSS 3.1 score 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Successful exploitation enables unauthorized access, data leakage, and data manipulation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/dfsms/` with URL-encoded payload `username=admin%27+or+%271%27+%3D+%271%27%3B+--+-&password=A&login=` (classic tautology bypass in the login form) and matches on both HTTP 302 status and the presence of `add-category.php` in the `Location` response header to confirm successful redirection to the administrative panel.
