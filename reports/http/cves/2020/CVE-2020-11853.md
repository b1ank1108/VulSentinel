## Vulnerability
Micro Focus Operations Bridge Manager <=2020.05 is vulnerable to remote code execution via the UCMDB component. The flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Data Center Automation. Exploitation requires network access and authentication as a valid application user. Originated from Metasploit module #14654.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/ucmdb-api/connect` and matches for the presence of both `"HttpUcmdbServiceProviderFactoryImpl"` and `"ServerVersion=11.6.0"` strings in the response body (status 200) to fingerprint vulnerable versions.
