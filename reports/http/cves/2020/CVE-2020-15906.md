## Vulnerability
Tiki Wiki CMS GroupWare before 21.2 contains an authentication bypass in `tiki-login.php`: 50 invalid login attempts reset the admin password to a blank value, allowing unauthenticated attackers to gain complete administrative access to the CMS and all content.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template extracts a CSRF ticket from `/tiki-login_scr.php`, performs a batteringram attack sending 50 POSTs to `/tiki-login.php` as `user=admin` with invalid passwords, extracts a fresh ticket, logs in with blank password, then requests `/tiki-index.php` and matches admin-interface strings ("System Menu", "Home", "Search", "Wiki", "File Galleries", "Settings", "Show on admin log-in", "Tiki Setup") to confirm successful privilege escalation.
