## Vulnerability
EyesOfNetwork 5.3 (API 2.4.2) is affected by unauthenticated SQL injection in `include/api_functions.php:getApiKey` via the `username` parameter, combined with a hardcoded API key (`1c85d47ff80b5ff2a4dd577e8e5f8e9d`). Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication, impersonate admin, and obtain full access to the monitoring system plus all monitored infrastructure data. CWE-798 (hardcoded credentials). CVSS 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs direct unauthenticated exploitation checks against `/eonapi/getApiKey`:
- Raw request 1 injects UNION SELECT payload to force return of admin user with hardcoded API key; matcher requires status_code_1 == 200 and "EONAPI_KEY" in body_1.
- Raw request 2 injects time-based blind SQLi (`sleep(6)`) payload; matcher requires duration_2 >= 6, status_code_2 == 401, and body containing "api_version" + "username-password credentials".
`stop-at-first-match: true` with OR matcher-condition for efficient verification.
