## Vulnerability
Cockpit CMS before 0.6.1 suffers from a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2020-35131, CWE-94) due to unsafe usage of `registerCriteriaFunction` in `lib/MongoLite/Database.php`. Malicious values in JSON payloads sent to `/auth/check` or `/auth/requestreset` allow injection of arbitrary PHP code.

**CVSS Score:** 9.8  
**Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  
**Impact:** Unauthenticated attackers can inject custom PHP code to achieve remote command execution, leading to complete Cockpit CMS compromise.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to Cockpit CMS version 0.6.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template verifies exploitability by issuing two raw POST requests (stop-at-first-match) with PHP code injection (`.phpinfo().`) embedded in the `user` field of JSON bodies (using random username/password) to `/auth/check` and `/auth/requestreset`. Detection succeeds if the server responds with HTTP 200 and the response body contains both "cockpit" and "PHP Extension" strings, confirming the injected `phpinfo()` executed.
