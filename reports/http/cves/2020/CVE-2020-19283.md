## Vulnerability
Jeesns 1.4.2 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting in the /newVersion component and allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in a victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1) | CWE-79.

Remediation: Upgrade Jeesns to the latest version or apply the vendor-provided patch to fix the XSS vulnerability.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/newVersion?callback=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` and confirms the reflected XSS if the unsanitized payload string appears verbatim in the response body, the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
