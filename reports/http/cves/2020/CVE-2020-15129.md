## Vulnerability
Traefik before 1.7.26, 2.2.8, and 2.3.0-rc3 contains an open redirect vulnerability via the X-Forwarded-Prefix header. An attacker can manipulate the redirect URL to point to a malicious site, tricking users into visiting it and potentially obtaining sensitive information, modifying data, or executing unauthorized operations. CVSS 3.1 score 4.7 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). CWE-601.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` while injecting the header `X-Forwarded-Prefix: "https://foo.nl"`. It verifies the open redirect by matching on HTTP status 302 combined with the exact string `<a href="https://foo.nl/dashboard/">Found</a>` appearing in the response body.
