## Vulnerability
Apache HTTP Server 2.4.32 to 2.4.44 contains an information disclosure and possible remote code execution caused by a vulnerability in mod_proxy_uwsgi. Remote attackers can access sensitive information and potentially execute arbitrary code by sending crafted requests. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8, CWE-120). Impact includes potential full compromise of the web server and hosted applications. Remediation: update to version 2.4.45 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a single raw POST request to `/` (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded) containing a base64-decoded UWSGI protocol payload. The payload is modified by replacing a placeholder domain with a 54-character-padded interactsh subdomain (`{{padding(oast,'a',54,'prefix')}}`) to trigger `exec://curl` command execution to the attacker-controlled OOB domain. Detection matches on the resulting interactsh HTTP callback containing `interactsh_protocol: http` and `User-Agent: curl` in the request.
