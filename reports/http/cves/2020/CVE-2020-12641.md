## Vulnerability
Roundcube Webmail contains a command injection (CWE-78) vulnerability caused by unsanitized shell metacharacters in configuration settings for `im_convert_path` or `im_identify_path`. Attackers who can control these settings can execute arbitrary commands on the server.  
CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Impact: full system compromise.  
Remediation: update to 1.4.5 or 1.3.12 (or later).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a POST request to `{{BaseURL}}/installer/index.php` (or `/roundcube/installer/index.php`) containing form data that sets `_im_convert_path=curl http://example.com` along with default configuration values. It verifies success by matching HTTP 200 status and the exact strings "Roundcube Webmail Installer" and "The config file was saved successfully" in the response body (up to 2 requests).
