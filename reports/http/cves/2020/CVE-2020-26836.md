## Vulnerability
SAP Solution Manager contains an open redirect vulnerability via the logoff endpoint (`/sap/public/bc/icf/logoff`). An unauthenticated attacker can supply an arbitrary `redirecturl` parameter to force a 3xx redirect to a malicious domain of their choice. This enables phishing attacks that may result in credential theft, sensitive information disclosure, data modification, or unauthorized operations.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)  
CWE-601  
Remediation: Apply SAP security patches or updates.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only  
The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/sap/public/bc/icf/logoff?redirecturl=https://interact.sh` and verifies the response with an AND condition: HTTP status 301/302/307 **and** the `Location` header containing either `https://interact.sh` or `https://www.interact.sh`. This confirms the endpoint blindly reflects the attacker-controlled redirect target.
