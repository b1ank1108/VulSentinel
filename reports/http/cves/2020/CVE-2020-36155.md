## Vulnerability
Ultimate Member WordPress plugin before 2.1.12 is vulnerable to unauthenticated privilege escalation via user meta manipulation. During registration, arbitrary metadata arrays (including `wp_capabilities[administrator]`) are blindly accepted and passed to the `update_profile` function, allowing any visitor to create an administrator account. 

Impact: Unauthenticated attackers can escalate privileges to administrator during registration, gaining complete control over the WordPress site and all user data.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 10.0). CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management.  
Fixed in 2.1.12.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template executes the full unauthenticated exploit chain to confirm privilege escalation:  
- GET `/register/` extracts `_wpnonce` and form ID (`um-xxx`) from the registration page.  
- POST `/register` submits crafted form data with `wp_capabilities%5Badministrator%5D=` plus random username/password/email, creating a new admin account.  
- GET `/wp-admin/users.php` verifies admin access (302 + `wordpress_logged_in` cookie + admin UI strings “Edit Profile”, “All Posts”) and extracts the created credentials.

The flow is intrusive and actually provisions a persistent administrator account on the target.
