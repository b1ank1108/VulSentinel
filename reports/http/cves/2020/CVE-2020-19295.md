## Vulnerability
Jeesns 1.4.2 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the `/weibo/topic` component. Attackers can execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the URL path, specifically targeting the system error message's text field (unsanitized reflection of user-controlled input).

CVSS v3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) | CWE-79

Successful exploitation could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or website defacement in the victim's browser context. Remediation requires upgrading to the latest version or applying the vendor-provided patch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/weibo/topic/%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` and confirms the vulnerability if the response body contains the unsanitized payload string `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` (case-insensitive AND alongside `JEESNS`), returns status 200, and has `text/html` content-type. This verifies unsafe reflection of user-controlled input from the path.
