## Vulnerability

exacqVision Web Service and exacqVision Enterprise Manager contain a remote code execution vulnerability (CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) that allows attackers with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary operating system commands. The vulnerability affects exacqVision Web Service versions 20.06.3.0 and prior, and exacqVision Enterprise Manager versions 20.06.4.0 and prior.

An authenticated attacker with administrative access can potentially download and execute malicious code on the system, leading to complete system compromise. The CVSS v3.1 score is 7.2 (High), with the attack vector being network-based, low attack complexity, but requiring high privileges and no user interaction.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template performs version fingerprinting to detect vulnerable installations. It sends a GET request to `/version.web` endpoint and checks the response for specific vulnerable version strings. The matcher looks for 24 known vulnerable versions ranging from 3.8.2.67295 through 20.06.3.0, verifying both that one of these versions is present in the response body and that the server returns a 200 status code. While the template itself only performs version detection, the underlying vulnerability allows remote code execution through malicious executable downloads and OS command injection.
