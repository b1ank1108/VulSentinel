## Vulnerability
Fuel CMS 1.4.7 contains a SQL injection vulnerability via the `col` parameter in the `/fuel/pages/items`, `/fuel/permissions/items`, and `/fuel/navigation/items` endpoints. Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries leading to unauthorized data access, manipulation, or leakage. Fixed in version 115.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first confirms the target is Fuel CMS by fetching the login page, then authenticates using default credentials `admin:admin` (pitchfork attack). It subsequently issues a GET request to `/fuel/pages/items/?search_term=&published=&layout=&limit=50&view_type=list&offset=0&order=asc&col=location+AND+(SELECT+1340+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(6)))ULQV)&fuel_inline=0` with a time-based blind SQLi payload and detects the vulnerability if response duration is ≥6 seconds, status_code_3==200, and the login page contains "FUEL CMS".
