## Vulnerability
JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools 9.2 (Oracle) is susceptible to information disclosure via the Monitoring and Diagnostics component. An unauthenticated attacker with HTTP network access can obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8).  
Impact: Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive information.  
Remediation: Apply the latest security patches or updates provided by the vendor.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/manage/fileDownloader?sec=1` and matches on status 200, `Content-Type` header containing `text/plain`, and the string `ACHCJK` present in the response body. This probe verifies the underlying information disclosure condition described in the CVE.
