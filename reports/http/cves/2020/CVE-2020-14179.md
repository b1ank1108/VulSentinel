## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-14179 is an information disclosure vulnerability affecting Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center versions before 8.5.8 and versions 8.6.0 through 8.11.1. The vulnerability exists in the `/secure/QueryComponent!Default.jspa` endpoint, which improperly exposes sensitive configuration information without requiring authentication.

An unauthenticated attacker can access this endpoint to view custom field names and custom SLA (Service Level Agreement) names configured within the Jira instance. This information disclosure can aid attackers in reconnaissance activities, revealing the internal structure and configuration of the Jira deployment, which may facilitate further targeted attacks.

The CVSS v3.1 score is 5.3 (Medium severity) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation with low complexity, no privileges required, and low confidentiality impact. The EPSS score of 0.92578 (99.733rd percentile) suggests a very high probability of active exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated GET request to the `/secure/QueryComponent!Default.jspa` endpoint. The detection logic verifies the presence of the vulnerability by checking for:

1. A successful HTTP 200 status response
2. JSON response content containing all three indicators:
   - `{"searchers":` - indicating the query component structure
   - `"groups":` - indicating group configuration data
   - `"id":"customfield` - indicating custom field definitions are exposed

The template confirms information disclosure when the endpoint returns structured JSON data containing internal Jira configuration details that should not be publicly accessible. This detection method is non-invasive and only reads the exposed data without modifying any system state.
