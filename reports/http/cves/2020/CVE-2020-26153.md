## Vulnerability
Event Espresso Core-Reg WordPress plugin (CWE-79, CVE-2020-26153) contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in `wp-content/plugins/event-espresso-core-reg/admin_pages/messages/templates/ee_msg_admin_overview.template.php`. The `page` parameter is not sanitized, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Successful exploitation enables arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context, leading to sensitive information theft or unauthorized actions. Fixed by upgrading to 4.10.7.p or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-request flow to detect the vulnerability. First it fetches `/wp-content/plugins/event-espresso-core-reg/readme.txt` (internal matcher) and confirms the plugin is present via the strings "Event Espresso" and "Tested up to:". Second it issues a GET to the vulnerable admin template endpoint with the reflected XSS payload `page=""/></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script><b` and verifies reflection of the breakout string in the response body, Content-Type text/html, and HTTP 500 status.
