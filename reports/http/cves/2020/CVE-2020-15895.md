## Vulnerability
D-Link DIR-816L 2.x devices contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `webinc/js/info.php`. No output filtration is applied to the `RESULT` query parameter before it is printed on the webpage. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the context of the victim's browser on the affected site, enabling theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, defacement, or other attacks.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)  
CWE-79

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/info.php?RESULT=\",msgArray);alert(document.domain);//` and verifies the condition with an `and` matcher requiring: the response body contains both `;alert(document.domain);` and `DIR-816L`, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and HTTP status is 200. This confirms the `RESULT` parameter is reflected unsanitized, proving the reflected XSS flaw.
