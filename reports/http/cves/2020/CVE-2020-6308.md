## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-6308 is a blind server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (Web Services) versions 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. The vulnerability exists in the Web Services component where an attacker can inject arbitrary values as CMS (Central Management Server) parameters through the `/AdminTools/querybuilder/logon` endpoint. This allows attackers to perform lookups on the internal network that would otherwise be inaccessible from external networks.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) and has a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.3 (Medium severity) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation requiring no privileges or user interaction, with low confidentiality impact.

Successful exploitation enables attackers to scan internal network infrastructure, gather information for further attacks including remote file inclusion, retrieve server files, bypass firewall restrictions, and force malicious requests from the vulnerable server to internal resources.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending a POST request to the `/AdminTools/querybuilder/logon?framework=` endpoint with a crafted payload that injects an Interactsh URL into the `aps` parameter (along with dummy credentials in `usr`, `pwd`, and `aut` parameters). The template verifies the SSRF vulnerability through two conditions:

1. Detection of DNS interaction with the Interactsh server, confirming that the vulnerable server made an outbound request to the attacker-controlled domain
2. Verification that the response includes a redirect to `/AdminTools/querybuilder/logonform.jsp`, indicating the request was processed by the vulnerable endpoint

This blind SSRF detection relies on out-of-band DNS callbacks to confirm that the server processes and attempts to resolve the injected URL, demonstrating the ability to force the server to make arbitrary network requests.
