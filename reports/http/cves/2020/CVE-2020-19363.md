## Vulnerability
Vtiger CRM v7.2.0 contains a directory listing vulnerability (described as directory traversal due to improper access controls) in the `/libraries` and `/layouts` directories. Unauthenticated remote attackers can list directory contents, view "Parent Directory" links, and access hidden files from internal libraries such as Smarty, PHPExcel, adodb, nusoap, tcpdf and v7 components. 

Impact: information disclosure of sensitive file structures that can enable further exploitation.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3, CWE-200).  
Remediation: update to latest version or apply patches enforcing proper access controls on these paths.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues unauthenticated GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/vtigercrm/libraries/` and `{{BaseURL}}/vtigercrm/layouts/` (stop-at-first-match). It verifies exposure when status_code == 200 and body contains all of "Index of", "vtigercrm", "Parent Directory" plus any of the library strings ("Smarty", "PHPExcel", "adodb", "nusoap", "tcpdf", "vlayout", "v7").
