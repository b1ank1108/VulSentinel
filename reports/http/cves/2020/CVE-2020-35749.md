## Vulnerability

WordPress Simple Job Board plugin prior to version 2.9.4 contains a local file inclusion vulnerability. The plugin fails to validate the `sjb_file` parameter when viewing a resume, allowing authenticated users with the `download_resume` capability (such as HR users) to download arbitrary files from the web server. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) with a CVSS score of 7.7 (High severity). The attack vector is network-based with low attack complexity, requires low privileges, no user interaction, and has a changed scope with high confidentiality impact but no integrity or availability impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs authenticated exploitation by:

1. **Authentication Step**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with username and password credentials to establish an authenticated WordPress session
2. **Exploitation Step**: Sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/post.php` with parameters `post=372&action=edit&sjb_file=../../../../etc/passwd`, attempting to traverse the directory structure and read the `/etc/passwd` file
3. **Verification**: Confirms successful exploitation by matching the regex pattern `root:[x*]:0:0` (typical `/etc/passwd` entry format) in the response with HTTP status 200

The template demonstrates the local file inclusion vulnerability by reading a sensitive system file, proving arbitrary file retrieval capability.
