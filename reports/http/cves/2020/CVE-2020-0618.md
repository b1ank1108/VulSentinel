## Vulnerability
Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services is vulnerable to remote code execution because it incorrectly handles page requests (ViewState deserialization, CWE-502).  

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.  
- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 8.8)  
- Impact: full confidentiality, integrity, and availability compromise  
- Remediation: apply latest Microsoft security updates  

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  

The template performs a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/ReportServer/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx` and matches on HTTP 200 status code combined with the presence of the string `value="View Report"` in the response body. This fingerprints exposed SSRS ReportViewer instances vulnerable to the deserialization flaw.
