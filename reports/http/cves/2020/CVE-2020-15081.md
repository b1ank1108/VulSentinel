## Vulnerability

PrestaShop versions from 1.5.0.0 up to (but not including) 1.7.6.6 are vulnerable to information exposure through directory listing in the upload directory. The vulnerability exists due to a missing `index.php` file in the `/upload/` directory, which allows web servers to display directory contents when accessed directly. This configuration weakness (CWE-548) enables unauthorized users to enumerate uploaded files without authentication, potentially exposing sensitive customer data, invoices, or internal documents. The CVSS score of 5.3 reflects medium-low severity with network-based attack vector, low complexity, and no privileges required, resulting in confidentiality impact only.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the `/upload/` path on the target PrestaShop installation. It verifies the presence of directory listing by checking for two conditions:
1. HTTP status code 200 (successful response)
2. Response body contains common directory listing indicators such as "Index of", "Directory listing for", "[To Parent Directory]", or "<title>Index of"

The template follows up to 2 redirects to handle various server configurations. Successful detection confirms that the upload directory is accessible and its contents can be enumerated by unauthenticated users.
