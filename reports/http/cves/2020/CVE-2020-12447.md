## Vulnerability
Onkyo TX-NR585 Web Interface suffers from a directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2020-12447, CWE-22) affecting firmware version 1000-0000-000-0008-0000. Remote unauthenticated attackers on the network can exploit encoded `../` sequences (%2e%2e%2f) to perform local file inclusion and read sensitive files such as /etc/passwd.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5 High). Impact includes information disclosure potentially enabling further system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd` (multi-level traversal) and verifies exploitation success via status code 200 combined with regex match for "root:[x*]:0:0" in the response body.
