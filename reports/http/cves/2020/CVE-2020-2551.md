## Vulnerability
Oracle WebLogic Server (Oracle Fusion Middleware component: WLS Core Components) is susceptible to a remote code execution vulnerability. Supported versions affected: 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, 12.2.1.3.0 and 12.2.1.4.0. This easily exploitable flaw allows unauthenticated attackers with network access via IIOP to compromise the server.

CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Impact: arbitrary code execution on the target system.  
Remediation: apply latest Oracle security patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/console/login/LoginForm.jsp` and applies matchers requiring status 200, presence of the string "WebLogic" in the response body, and any of the vulnerable version substrings ("10.3.6.0", "12.1.3.0", "12.2.1.3", "12.2.1.4") also in the body. This performs passive version fingerprinting to confirm an affected installation; the actual RCE occurs via IIOP and is not exercised by the template.
