## Vulnerability
rConfig 3.9.4 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of the `deviceId` GET parameter in `devicemgmt.php`. An authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser context when the page is visited.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 5.4).  
CWE-79.  
Impact includes session-cookie theft and unauthorized administrative actions on behalf of the victim user.  
Remediation: upgrade to rConfig 3.9.7 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a three-step authenticated probe:  
1. GET `/login.php` to start the session.  
2. POST credentials (`user`/`pass`) to `/lib/crud/userprocess.php`.  
3. GET `/devicemgmt.php?deviceId="><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` containing the reflected-XSS payload.  

Detection succeeds on HTTP 200, presence of the unsanitized `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` string in the response body, and the rConfig page title signature. This verifies the parameter reflection without HTML escaping, confirming JavaScript execution is possible.
