## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-35713 is a critical remote command execution vulnerability affecting Belkin LINKSYS RE6500 router devices running firmware versions prior to 1.0.012.001. The vulnerability exists in the `/goform/setSysAdm` endpoint, which fails to properly sanitize user input before passing it to system commands. Attackers can inject shell metacharacters into the `admpass` parameter to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the device. The vulnerability requires no authentication, making it exploitable by any remote attacker with network access to the device's web interface. This is classified as CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating maximum severity across confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending a POST request to the `/goform/setSysAdm` endpoint with a crafted payload that injects a `wget` command into the `admpass` parameter. The payload uses shell metacharacters (semicolons) to break out of the intended command context and execute `wget http://{{interactsh-url}}/`, which attempts to make an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled Interactsh server. The template confirms successful command execution by monitoring for HTTP callbacks received at the Interactsh URL, verifying that the injected command was executed by the device. This demonstrates that arbitrary commands can be executed remotely without authentication.
