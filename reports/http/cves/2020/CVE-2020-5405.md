## Vulnerability
Spring Cloud Config (via spring-cloud-config-server module) suffers from a path-traversal local file inclusion flaw. An unauthenticated remote attacker can force the server to return arbitrary files from the local filesystem by supplying specially encoded `../` sequences in configuration-resource URLs.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/a/b/%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd` and confirms exploitation if the HTTP response is 200 OK and the body contains the regex `root:.*:0:0:` (signature of a readable /etc/passwd file).
