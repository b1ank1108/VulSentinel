## Vulnerability
SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (LM Configuration Wizard) versions 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 does not perform an authentication check on the CTCWebService/ConfigServlet endpoint. Unauthenticated remote attackers can therefore execute arbitrary configuration tasks, including creation of new administrative users (with full Administrator role assignments), resulting in complete compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of the SAP Java system.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 10.0) | CWE-306 | KEV-listed.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template actively exploits the flaw by issuing a single unauthenticated raw POST to `/CTCWebService/CTCWebServiceBean/ConfigServlet` containing a SOAP envelope with base64-encoded `baData` payload that triggers user-management configuration: it creates the backdoor administrator account `sapRpoc6351` (password `Secure!PwD8890`) and assigns it Administrator, Monitor, and Receiver roles. Detection succeeds only on HTTP 200 together with the response body containing both `CTCWebServiceSi` and `SOAP-ENV`, plus the `Content-Type: text/xml` header referencing `SAP NetWeaver Application Server`.
