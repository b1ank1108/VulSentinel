## Vulnerability
Rank Math SEO plugin for WordPress (through 1.0.40.2) allows unauthenticated attackers to create arbitrary redirect URIs via the unsecured `rankmath/v1/updateRedirection` REST API endpoint. Attackers can register new URIs (e.g. `/exampleredirect`) that redirect to external malicious sites. Not an open redirect but unauthorized redirect creation for phishing, SEO manipulation, or malware distribution.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template sends a POST request to `/wp-json/rankmath/v1/updateRedirection` with JSON body containing a random `redirectionSources` path and external `redirectionUrl`, along with `hasRedirect: "true"`. Success is matched via DSL checking for status 200, JSON content-type, and body containing "update" and "Redirection updated successfully."
