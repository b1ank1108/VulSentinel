## Vulnerability
Jeedom through 4.0.38 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2020-9036, CWE-79). An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript via the `p` query parameter on `/index.php`, executing in the victim's browser context with the site's privileges. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Successful exploitation enables session hijacking, page defacement, or theft of sensitive information such as cookies and local storage. Fixed in 4.0.39+.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues one unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?v=d&p=%22;alert(document.domain);%22`. It matches on the exact reflected payload string appearing inside a `<script>` tag in the response body, confirms `text/html` Content-Type header, and HTTP 200 status to verify unsanitized reflection and successful XSS condition.
