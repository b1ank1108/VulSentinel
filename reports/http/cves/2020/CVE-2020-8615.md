## Vulnerability
Tutor LMS WordPress plugin before 1.5.3 contains a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF, CWE-352) vulnerability on instructor management endpoints. An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into submitting forged requests, resulting in self-approval as an instructor or blocking of legitimate instructors.  

Impact: Attackers can exploit CSRF to approve themselves as instructors or block legitimate instructors, potentially disrupting the learning management system.  
Remediation: Update to version 1.5.3.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N (score 6.5).  

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change  

The template first issues a POST to /wp-login.php with username/password credentials to establish an authenticated session. It then sends a raw POST to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php containing action=add_new_instructor along with randomly generated first_name, last_name, user_login, email, password, and profile bio. Detection succeeds if the second response meets all DSL conditions: content-type contains application/json, body contains "success" and "true" and "Instructor has been added successfully", and status_code == 200.
