## Vulnerability
Canvas LMS version 2020-07-29 suffers from a blind server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CWE-918). An unauthenticated remote attacker can induce the server to perform HTTP GET requests to arbitrary attacker-controlled domains via the `/external_content/retrieve/oembed` endpoint. This can enable internal network scanning, access to sensitive internal resources, data leakage, and potentially further attacks like modifying data or RCE depending on reachable services.

CVSS 3.1 score: 5.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N). Impact includes unauthorized internal access and information disclosure.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the blind SSRF by issuing a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/external_content/retrieve/oembed?endpoint=http://{{interactsh-url}}&url=foo` and verifying an out-of-band HTTP interaction with the interactsh server, confirming that the application fetched the attacker-specified URL without direct response reflection.
