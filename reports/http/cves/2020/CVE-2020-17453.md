## Vulnerability

WSO2 Carbon Management Console through version 5.10 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via manipulation of request parameters in the Management Console, specifically the `msgId` parameter on the `/carbon/admin/login.jsp` endpoint. The flaw allows arbitrary JavaScript injection and can be exploited through both authenticated and unauthenticated requests.

CVSS: 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE: CWE-79

Exploitation may result in data theft, session hijacking, or application defacement in the victim's browser context.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/carbon/admin/login.jsp?msgId=%27%3Balert(%27document.domain%27)%2F%2F` containing a reflected XSS payload. It verifies exploitation conditions by checking for the unsanitized payload reflection (`'';alert('document.domain')//';`) in the response body, confirming HTML content-type, and HTTP 200 status.
