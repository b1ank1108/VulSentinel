## Vulnerability

Extreme Management Center 8.4.1.24 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via unsanitized input in a GET parameter of the `/OneView/view/center` endpoint (CVE-2020-13820, CWE-79). Attacker-supplied JavaScript is reflected in the page response and executed in the victim's browser in the context of the site. This enables session hijacking via cookie theft, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Impact includes arbitrary client-side script execution leading to credential theft and further attacks.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/OneView/view/center?a%27+type%3d+%27text%27+autofocus+onfocus%3d%27alert(document.domain)`. It confirms the reflected XSS by verifying that the response body contains the exact unsanitized payload string "autofocus onfocus='alert(document.domain)" (plus the page title "Extreme Management Center"), returns HTTP 200, and has Content-Type text/html.
