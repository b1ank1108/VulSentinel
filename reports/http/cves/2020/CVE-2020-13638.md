## Vulnerability

CVE-2020-13638 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in rConfig versions 3.9.x prior to 3.9.7. The vulnerability exists in `lib/crud/userprocess.php` and allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms entirely. Exploiting this flaw enables attackers to create administrator accounts without any prior authentication, granting complete control over the rConfig installation and access to all managed network device configurations. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating maximum severity across availability, confidentiality, and integrity impacts. The EPSS score of 0.92196 (99.7th percentile) indicates this vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a three-step verification process to confirm the authentication bypass vulnerability:

1. **Account Creation**: Sends a POST request to `/lib/crud/userprocess.php` with multipart form data containing randomly generated credentials (username, password, email) and critically sets `ulevelid=9` (administrator privilege level) without any authentication headers or session tokens.

2. **Session Establishment**: Retrieves the login page at `/login.php` to establish a session context.

3. **Login Verification**: Attempts to authenticate using the newly created credentials via POST to `/lib/crud/userprocess.php` with the generated username and password.

The template confirms successful exploitation by verifying the response contains indicators of successful administrator login: "rConfig - Configuration Management", "Logged in as", and "dashboadFieldSet" strings in the response body, along with a 200 status code and HTML content type. This demonstrates that an administrator account was successfully created and authenticated without any prior credentials.
