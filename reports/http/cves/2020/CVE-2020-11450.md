## Vulnerability
MicroStrategy Web prior to version 11.0 (10.4 explicitly affected) exposes the Axis2 Happiness Page at `/MicroStrategyWS/happyaxis.jsp`. This leaks JVM configuration, CPU architecture, installation folder, and additional environment details. The flaw enables reconnaissance that may lead to further compromise including sensitive data access, modification, or unauthorized operations (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, score 7.5).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/MicroStrategyWS/happyaxis.jsp` (following up to 2 redirects) and confirms exposure by matching HTTP 200 status together with the exact phrases "Axis2 Happiness Page", "Examining webapp configuration", and "Essential Components" in the response body.
