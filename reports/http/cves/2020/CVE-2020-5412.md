affected_product: Spring Cloud Netflix
severity: medium
authentication: none
external_callback: true
affected_versions: Spring Cloud Netflix 2.2.x prior to 2.2.4, 2.1.x prior to 2.1.6, and older unsupported versions
preconditions: Hystrix Dashboard proxy.stream endpoint must be enabled and accessible
poc_classification: info-leak

## Vulnerability
Spring Cloud Netflix (Hystrix Dashboard) contains a server-side request forgery flaw in the `/proxy.stream` endpoint. An unauthenticated remote attacker can supply an arbitrary `origin` parameter and force the server to issue HTTP requests to any host reachable from the dashboard host, enabling internal service enumeration, sensitive data exfiltration (including cloud metadata), data modification on reachable backends, or further unauthorized operations.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 6.5).  
CWE: CWE-610, CWE-441.  
Impact: unauthorized access to internal resources and potential data breaches.  
Remediation: upgrade to Spring Cloud Netflix 2.2.4+, 2.1.6+, or latest supported release.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/proxy.stream?origin=http://{{interactsh-url}}`. Detection succeeds when an HTTP interaction is observed on the interactsh server, the response header contains the word "Jelly", and the status code is 200. A critical hit can also be obtained by targeting internal metadata endpoints (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/latest/metadata/`).
