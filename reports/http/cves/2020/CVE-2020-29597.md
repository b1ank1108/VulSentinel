## Vulnerability
IncomCMS 2.0 contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in `modules/uploader/showcase/script.php`. Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files to the server, potentially enabling remote code execution, data leakage, and unauthorized server access.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-434.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a POST multipart/form-data request to `/incom/modules/uploader/showcase/script.php` containing a randomly-named `.png` file with arbitrary text/html content. It matches the JSON response body for `{"status":"1","name":"..."}`, then issues a GET to `/upload/userfiles/image/{{randstr_1}}.png` and verifies the uploaded payload is echoed back unchanged.
