## Vulnerability

D-Link DCS-2530L and DCS-2670L IP cameras contain an unauthenticated administrator password disclosure vulnerability. The `/config/getuser` endpoint exposes sensitive user credentials without requiring any authentication. An attacker can remotely retrieve administrator passwords by simply accessing this endpoint with an index parameter. This vulnerability affects DCS-2530L firmware versions before 1.06.01 Hotfix and DCS-2670L firmware versions through 2.02. The flaw allows complete unauthorized access to camera administration, enabling attackers to take full control of affected devices.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated GET request to `/config/getuser?index=0`. The detection verifies the presence of the vulnerability by checking for:
1. Response body containing both `name=` and `pass=` strings, indicating user credential disclosure
2. Content-Type header set to `text/plain`
3. HTTP 200 status code

The template confirms that the endpoint improperly exposes administrator credentials in plain text format without requiring authentication.
