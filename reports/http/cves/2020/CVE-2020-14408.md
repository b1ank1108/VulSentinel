## Vulnerability
Agentejo Cockpit 0.10.2 is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The flaw exists in the `/auth/login` endpoint where the `to` parameter is insufficiently sanitized, permitting injection of arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser context upon visiting a maliciously crafted URL.

Impact includes potential session hijacking, page defacement, and theft of sensitive information. CVSS 3.1 score: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/auth/login?to=/92874%27;alert(document.domain)//280` and verifies exploitation conditions by checking for unsanitized reflection of the payload in the response body (specifically in a `redirectTo` JavaScript assignment), along with HTTP 200 status and `text/html` content-type.
