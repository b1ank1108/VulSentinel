## Vulnerability
Mitel MiCollab AWV (Audio, Web & Video Conferencing) before 8.1.2.4 and 9.x before 9.1.3 contains a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in the web conference component's `vcs_access_file.cgi`. Insufficient path validation allows unauthenticated attackers to access arbitrary files from restricted server directories via crafted URLs containing excessive `../` sequences.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3). Successful exploitation discloses sensitive information (e.g., `/etc/passwd`); advisory notes potential for view/modify/delete of arbitrary files leading to unauthorized access or data leakage.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the vulnerability with a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/awcuser/cgi-bin/vcs_access_file.cgi?file=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f/etc/passwd`. Success is confirmed by an AND matcher requiring:
- regex match `root:.*:0:0:` in response body (proving `/etc/passwd` contents leaked)
- response headers containing both `application/x-download` and `filename=passwd`
- HTTP status 200

This non-destructive probe directly exercises the LFI flaw by retrieving and forcing download of the system password file.
