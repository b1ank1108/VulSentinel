## Vulnerability
Hardcoded credential vulnerability in the 'zyfwp' user account (password: PrOw!aN_fXp) of ZyXel USG firewalls and AP controllers. The account was designed exclusively for automatic firmware updates to connected access points via FTP but enables full unauthenticated remote access to the device web management interface.

CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues two sequential raw HTTP requests: first a GET /?username=zyfwp&password=PrOw!aN_fXp to authenticate with the hardcoded credentials, then a GET /ext-js/index.html. It confirms successful exploitation by matching the second response body for the strings 'data-qtip="Web Console', 'CLI', and 'Configuration' (AND condition) plus HTTP 200 status.
