## Vulnerability
WordPress 15Zine theme before version 3.3.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. The `cbi` parameter passed to the `cb_s_a` AJAX action in `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` is not sanitized and is directly included in the HTTP response.

An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload that executes in the victim's browser when the link is visited (requires user interaction). 

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1 - Medium). Impact includes potential session hijacking, page defacement, or sensitive information theft.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs an internal check by requesting `/wp-content/themes/15zine/readme.txt` and matching for theme-specific strings to confirm installation. It then sends a GET request to the AJAX endpoint with `cbi=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies if the unsanitized payload is reflected in the response body, alongside HTTP 200 status and text/html content-type.
