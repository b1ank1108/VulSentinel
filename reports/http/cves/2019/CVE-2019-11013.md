## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-11013 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability affecting Nimble Streamer versions 3.0.2-2 through 3.5.4-9. The vulnerability allows an attacker to traverse the file system and access files or directories outside of the restricted directory on the remote server. This path traversal flaw (CWE-22) enables unauthorized access to sensitive files, potentially leading to data leakage and further system exploitation. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 score of 6.5 (Medium severity) with the vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation with low attack complexity and high confidentiality impact. The EPSS score of 0.87349 (99.437th percentile) suggests a high probability of active exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by attempting to exploit the path traversal flaw to read the `/etc/passwd` file. It sends a GET request to the endpoint `/demo/file/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00filename.mp4/chunk.m3u8` with a `nimblesessionid` parameter. The detection uses directory traversal sequences (`../../../../../../../../`) combined with a null byte injection (`%00`) to bypass path restrictions and access the system password file. The template confirms successful exploitation by checking for two conditions: (1) the response contains a regex pattern matching typical `/etc/passwd` entries (`root:[x*]:0:0`), and (2) the HTTP response status is 200. This demonstrates the ability to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, confirming the local file inclusion vulnerability.
