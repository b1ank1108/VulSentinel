## Vulnerability

GrandNode 4.40 contains a local file inclusion vulnerability in the Controllers/LetsEncryptController.cs component. The vulnerability allows remote unauthenticated attackers to retrieve arbitrary files from the web server through specially crafted HTTP requests to the LetsEncrypt/Index endpoint with a malicious fileName parameter. This is a path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) that enables unauthorized file system access without requiring authentication. The CVSS v3.0 score is 7.5 (High), with an attack vector that is network-based, requires low complexity, no privileges, and no user interaction. The vulnerability has a high EPSS score of 0.9202 (99.691th percentile), indicating a very high probability of exploitation in the wild. A patch was released on 2019-05-30 for GrandNode 4.40.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the `/LetsEncrypt/Index` endpoint with a path traversal payload in the `fileName` parameter (`fileName=/etc/passwd`). The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for two conditions: (1) the response contains a regex pattern matching typical Unix password file entries (`root:.*:0:0:`), indicating the server returned the contents of `/etc/passwd`, and (2) the HTTP response status code is 200. This confirms that the application is vulnerable to local file inclusion and allows arbitrary file read access on the underlying file system.
