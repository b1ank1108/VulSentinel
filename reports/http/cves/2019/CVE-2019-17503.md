## Vulnerability

Kirona Dynamic Resource Scheduler contains an information disclosure vulnerability that allows unauthenticated users to directly access sensitive configuration files at `/osm/REGISTER.cmd` or `/osm_tiles/REGISTER.cmd`. These endpoints expose SQL queries containing database metadata including database version, table names, and column names. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-425 (Direct Request) with a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium severity). The exposed information can facilitate subsequent attacks such as SQL injection or targeted database exploitation by providing attackers with detailed knowledge of the underlying database structure.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending unauthenticated GET requests to two potential paths:
1. `/osm/REGISTER.cmd`
2. `/osm_tiles/REGISTER.cmd`

The detection logic verifies the presence of the vulnerability by checking for:
- HTTP 200 status code response
- Both strings "DEBUGMAPSCRIPT=TRUE" and "@echo off" present in the response body

These indicators confirm that the endpoint is accessible and returning the sensitive configuration/script file that contains exposed SQL queries and database metadata. The template performs a non-invasive read-only check to verify the information disclosure without attempting to exploit or extract the actual database information.
