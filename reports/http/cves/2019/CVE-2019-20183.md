## Vulnerability
Simple Employee Records System 1.0 contains an arbitrary/unrestricted file upload vulnerability in `/dashboard/uploadID.php` due to client-side-only file extension validation. Attackers can upload executable PHP code (disguised as images) to achieve remote code execution, unauthorized system access, and data compromise.

CWE-434. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 7.2). Tagged intrusive.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs a multi-step detection:  
1. Sends POST multipart/form-data to `/dashboard/uploadID.php` uploading `poc.php` (payload: `<?php echo md5('CVE-2019-20183'); unlink(__FILE__); ?>`) with `Content-Type: image/png`.  
2. Regex-extracts the server-generated filename from the upload response body.  
3. Issues GET to `/uploads/employees_ids/{{endpoint}}` and matches the MD5 hash `1ad0d710225c472cb7396b3c1d97e4dd` in the second response body to confirm successful PHP execution.
