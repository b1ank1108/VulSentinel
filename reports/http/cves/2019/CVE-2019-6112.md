## Vulnerability
WordPress Sell Media plugin (graphpaperpress) version 2.4.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in `/inc/class-search.php`. The `keyword` GET parameter (exposed via the public Search field at `/sell-media-search/`) is not sanitized before output in the HTML response body. 

Unauthenticated remote attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML. Successful exploitation executes malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser context (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, score 6.1). Impact includes session hijacking, page defacement, or theft of sensitive information such as cookies and localStorage.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/sell-media-search/?keyword=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281337%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`. It verifies exploitation conditions by confirming HTTP 200 status and AND-matching two strings in the response body: the legitimate Sell Media search input element (`id="sell-media-search-text" class="sell-media-search-text"`) plus the unsanitized payload string `alert(1337)`. This confirms the `keyword` value is reflected verbatim, proving the reflected XSS flaw.
