## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-7219 is an unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Zarafa WebApp version 2.0.1.47791 and earlier. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of an unsuspecting user within the context of the affected application. This is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).

The vulnerability exists in the webapp endpoint where user-supplied input is reflected in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript payloads that, when accessed by a victim, will execute in their browser session. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, defacement, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the victim's authenticated session.

Zarafa WebApp is a discontinued product. While the issue was addressed in later versions, some former customers have migrated to the related Kopano product. The CVSS v3.0 score is 6.1 (Medium), with the attack vector being network-based, low attack complexity, no privileges required, but requiring user interaction.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this XSS vulnerability by sending a GET request to the `/webapp/` endpoint with a crafted query parameter containing an XSS payload: `?fccc%27\%22%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(/xss/)%3E`. This payload attempts to inject an SVG element with an onload event handler that would execute JavaScript.

The template verifies the vulnerability through three conditions:
1. The injected payload `<svg/onload=alert(/xss/)>` is reflected unencoded in the response body
2. The response Content-Type header is `text/html`, confirming the payload is rendered in an HTML context
3. The server returns a 200 OK status code

All three conditions must be met for positive detection, confirming that the application reflects user input without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.
