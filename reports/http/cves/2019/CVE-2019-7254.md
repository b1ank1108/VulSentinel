## Vulnerability

Linear eMerge E3-Series devices version 1.00-06 are vulnerable to local file inclusion (LFI) due to improper input validation (CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory). The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to traverse the file system and access arbitrary files on the affected device through directory traversal sequences in HTTP request parameters.

The CVSS v3.1 score is 7.5 (High), with the vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation with low complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction, and high confidentiality impact. The EPSS score of 0.906 (99.6th percentile) indicates a very high probability of active exploitation in the wild.

Successful exploitation enables unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on the device, including system configuration files, credentials, and potentially other sensitive data. While the primary impact is information disclosure, the description notes that this could lead to remote code execution and complete system compromise as a secondary effect.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by attempting to read the `/etc/passwd` file through two different LFI vectors:

1. **Root-level parameter injection**: Sends a GET request to `/?c=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` using directory traversal sequences with a null byte terminator
2. **Badge printing module exploitation**: Sends a GET request to `/badging/badge_print_v0.php?tpl=../../../../../etc/passwd` targeting a specific vulnerable endpoint

The template confirms successful exploitation by:
- Matching the regex pattern `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body, which indicates the contents of the Unix/Linux password file
- Verifying an HTTP 200 status code is returned

Both conditions must be satisfied (matchers-condition: and) for the vulnerability to be confirmed. The template uses harmless file read operations to verify the LFI vulnerability exists without causing system damage.
