## Vulnerability
Jira before version 7.13.4, from version 8.0.0 before version 8.0.4, and from version 8.1.0 before version 8.1.1, allows remote attackers to access files in the Jira webroot under the META-INF directory via local file inclusion. Impact includes sensitive information exposure, unauthorized file access, and potential application compromise. Remediation requires applying the latest Atlassian security patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues two GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/s/{{randstr}}/_/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/maven/com.atlassian.jira/jira-core/pom.xml` and `{{BaseURL}}/s/{{randstr}}/_/META-INF/maven/com.atlassian.jira/atlassian-jira-webapp/pom.xml`. It confirms the LFI by matching the string `<groupId>com.atlassian.jira</groupId>` in the response body combined with HTTP 200 status.
