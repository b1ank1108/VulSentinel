## Vulnerability
Motors Car Dealer & Classified Ads (aka motors-car-dealership-classified-listings) WordPress plugin through version 1.4.0 contains an unauthenticated settings import/export flaw in includes/options.php. Attackers can arbitrarily modify plugin options (taxonomies, display settings, filters, etc.) without any credentials.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.5). CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity).  

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change  
The template performs a two-request detection sequence: (1) POST / with a multipart/form-data payload containing a crafted .json file that imports attacker-controlled values for single_name, plural_name, slug and multiple boolean/display fields; (2) GET /?export_settings=1. It then asserts that the random values appear in the exported JSON body and that the response header contains filename=file.json (status 200). This confirms the import succeeded and settings were persisted without authentication.
