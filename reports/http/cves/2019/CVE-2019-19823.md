## Vulnerability
Unauthenticated remote attackers can disclose the entire router configuration, including Wi-Fi passwords, admin credentials, and network settings, by accessing the `config.dat` file on the administration interface of Realtek APMIB-based routers (e.g., TOTOLINK models with Boa web server). This enables complete network takeover.

CVSS 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  
CWE-306

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/config.dat` and confirms exposure if all of the following match (AND condition):  
- `content_type` contains "text/plain"  
- `to_lower(server)` contains "boa"  
- `accept_ranges` contains "bytes"  
- `status_code == 200`
