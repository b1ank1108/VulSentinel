## Vulnerability

D-Link Central WiFi Manager CWM(100) before v1.03R0100_BETA6 is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution. The flaw exists in `/web/Lib/Action/IndexAction.class.php` where the `username` cookie field undergoes unsafe `eval` processing. An empty `password` cookie bypasses authentication, allowing arbitrary PHP code execution.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8). CWE-94 (Code Injection). Complete system compromise possible, including access to managed WiFi networks.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template sends one raw GET request to `/index.php/Index/index` injecting PHP `echo` payload via the `username` cookie (e.g. `',0,"",1,"0");echo "RANDOM";//`) with empty password. It confirms exploitation if the random string and `/public/css/` appear in the 200 OK response body.
