## Vulnerability
Pulse Secure Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) 8.2 before 8.2R12.1, 8.3 before 8.3R7.1, and 9.0 before 9.0R3.4 all contain an arbitrary file reading vulnerability that could allow unauthenticated remote attackers to send a specially crafted URI to gain improper access (CWE-22 path traversal). CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 10.0). Impact: An attacker can access sensitive information stored on the system, potentially leading to further compromise. Remediation: Apply the latest security patches and updates provided by Pulse Secure.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to the path-traversal payload `{{BaseURL}}/dana-na/../dana/html5acc/guacamole/../../../../../../etc/passwd?/dana/html5acc/guacamole/`. It verifies the vulnerability by confirming HTTP status 200 and a regex match for `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body.
