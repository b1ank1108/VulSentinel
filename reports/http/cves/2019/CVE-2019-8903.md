## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-8903 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability affecting Total.js Platform versions prior to 3.2.3. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) and allows remote attackers to traverse directories and read arbitrary files from the server filesystem without authentication. The CVSS v3.0 score is 7.5 (High), with the attack vector being network-based, requiring low complexity, no privileges, and no user interaction. The primary impact is on confidentiality (High), with no direct impact on integrity or availability. An attacker can exploit this flaw to access sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing configuration files, credentials, source code, or other confidential data that could facilitate further attacks or arbitrary code execution.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by attempting a directory traversal attack using encoded path sequences. It sends a GET request to `/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/var/www/html/index.html`, where `.%2e` represents URL-encoded `..` sequences designed to bypass path normalization. The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for two conditions: (1) the response body contains the string "apache2.conf" (indicating the default Apache index.html file was retrieved), and (2) the HTTP status code is 200. This detection method confirms that the application improperly handles path traversal sequences, allowing access to files outside the intended web root directory.
