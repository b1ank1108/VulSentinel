## Vulnerability

Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information due to improper access controls on specific URLs. Exploitation occurs by sending HTTP/HTTPS requests to endpoints such as `/cgi-bin/config.exp`, resulting in download of the full router configuration file or detailed diagnostic data.  
Impact: attacker gains router configuration and diagnostics, enabling further attacks.  
Remediation: apply Cisco firmware updates.  
Classification: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5), CWE-200 (Information Exposure), CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), EPSS 0.94378 (99.965th percentile).

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/cgi-bin/config.exp` and matches on HTTP 200 status code combined with the literal string `sysconfig` appearing in the response body, confirming the configuration file was returned.
