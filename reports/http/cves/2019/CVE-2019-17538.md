## Vulnerability
Jiangnan Online Judge (aka jnoj) 0.8.0 is susceptible to local file inclusion via `web/polygon/problem/viewfile?id=1&name=../`. The flaw stems from unsanitized path traversal in the `name` parameter, enabling arbitrary local file reads (CWE-22). CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5).

Impact: Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive information, including system files and credentials.

Remediation: Upgrade Jiangnan Online Judge to a patched version or apply the necessary security patches to fix the Local File Inclusion vulnerability.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw GET request to `/jnoj/web/polygon/problem/viewfile?id=1&name=../../../../../../../etc/passwd` (no authentication, cookies, or headers) and matches for HTTP 200 status plus the regex `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body to confirm successful LFI.
