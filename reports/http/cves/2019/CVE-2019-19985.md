## Vulnerability

WordPress Email Subscribers & Newsletters plugin versions before 4.2.3 contain an arbitrary file retrieval vulnerability (CWE-862: Missing Authorization). The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to download files and access user information without proper authorization checks. The flaw exists in the download_report functionality accessible through the wp-admin interface, which fails to verify user authentication before serving sensitive data.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information including user contact lists, email addresses, and subscriber data stored in the plugin's database. This information disclosure can lead to privacy violations, targeted phishing campaigns, and potential unauthorized access to user accounts. The CVSS v3.1 score is 5.3 (Medium), with the attack vector being network-based, requiring low complexity, and no privileges or user interaction.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated GET request to the vulnerable endpoint:

`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=download_report&report=users&status=all`

The detection verifies successful exploitation through three conditions:
1. The response body contains all four CSV header fields: "Name", "Email", "Status", and "Created On"
2. The response includes a Content-Disposition header indicating file download: `attachment; filename=all-contacts.csv;`
3. The server returns HTTP status 200

This confirms that the endpoint improperly serves a CSV file containing subscriber/user data without requiring authentication, demonstrating the arbitrary file retrieval vulnerability.
