## Vulnerability
WordPress API Bearer Auth plugin before 20190907 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The server parameter is not correctly filtered in swagger-config.yaml.php.

Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential data theft or unauthorized actions.

Remediation: Update to the latest version of WordPress API Bearer Auth plugin (20190907 or later).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET / request and internally matches for the string `/wp-content/plugins/api-bearer-auth/` to confirm the plugin is present. It then issues a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/api-bearer-auth/swagger/swagger-config.yaml.php` with the encoded payload `server=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. Detection triggers on status 200, text/html Content-Type, and the exact unsanitized payload string appearing in the response body.
