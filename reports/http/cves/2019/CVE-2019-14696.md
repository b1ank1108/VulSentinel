## Vulnerability

Open-School 3.0 and Community Edition 2.3 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the `id` parameter at `/index.php?r=students/guardians/create`.

CVSS v3.0: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE: CWE-79

Impact: Attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in victim's browser context, enabling session hijacking, website defacement, or sensitive data theft.  
Remediation: Implement proper input validation and output encoding/sanitization for the `id` parameter.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request with reflected XSS payload `1"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the `id` query parameter and matches for unescaped reflection in the HTML body (plus 200 OK and text/html Content-Type) to confirm the vulnerability.
