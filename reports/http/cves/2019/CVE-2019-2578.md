## Vulnerability

Oracle Fusion Middleware WebCenter Sites version 12.2.1.3.0 contains a broken access control vulnerability (CVE-2019-2578). The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to administrative interfaces that should be restricted. Successful exploitation can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle WebCenter Sites accessible data. The CVSS v3.0 score is 8.6 (High), with the attack vector being network-based, low attack complexity, requiring no privileges or user interaction, and having a changed scope with high confidentiality impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects this broken access control vulnerability by attempting to access two administrative pages without authentication:

1. First, it sends a GET request to `/cs/Satellite?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/Admin/WebReferences`
2. If that fails, it attempts `/cs/Satellite?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/Admin/Slots`

The template uses a stop-at-first-match strategy, meaning it will halt upon the first successful detection. The vulnerability is confirmed if the response body contains a specific pattern matching `<script[\d\D]*<throwexception/>`, which indicates successful access to the administrative interface. These administrative pages should normally require authentication but are accessible due to the broken access control flaw.
