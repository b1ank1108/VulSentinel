## Vulnerability
ThinVNC 1.0b1 (Cybelsoft) contains a directory traversal flaw (CWE-22) enabling arbitrary file reads via the vector `../../ThinVnc.ini`. The ThinVnc.ini configuration file stores VNC authentication credentials in plaintext. The issue exists even when authentication is turned on during deployment, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to extract credentials and fully compromise the VNC server. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues one unauthenticated raw GET request to `/{{randstr}}/../../ThinVnc.ini` (random prefix avoids caching) and confirms successful arbitrary file read via three matchers: body contains both "User=" and "Password=", header contains "application/binary", and status code is exactly 200.
