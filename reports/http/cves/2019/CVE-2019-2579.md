## Vulnerability

Oracle WebCenter Sites component of Oracle Fusion Middleware version 12.2.1.3.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability. The flaw exists in the WebReferences administration interface and is easily exploitable by low privileged attackers with network access via HTTP. Successful exploitation allows unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle WebCenter Sites accessible data. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 score of 4.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating low complexity exploitation requiring low privileges but resulting in limited confidentiality impact with no integrity or availability impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-step detection process:

1. **Authentication Key Extraction**: Sends a GET request to `/cs/Satellite?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/Admin/WebReferences` to retrieve an authentication key (`_authkey_`) from the response body using regex extraction.

2. **SQL Injection Probe**: Sends a POST request to `/cs/ContentServer` with the extracted authentication key and a SQL injection payload in the `searchText` parameter: `' and '1'='0 -- `. This payload attempts to manipulate the SQL query logic.

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking for:
- The reflected SQL injection payload in HTML-encoded form (`&#39; and &#39;1&#39;=&#39;0 --`) in the response
- The presence of the string "Use this utility to view and manage URLs" indicating successful access to the WebReferences utility
- HTTP 200 status code

The detection demonstrates that user-supplied input is incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization, allowing read access to database content.
