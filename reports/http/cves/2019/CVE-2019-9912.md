## Vulnerability
WP Google Maps plugin for WordPress (prior to 7.10.43) contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability via unsanitized PATH_INFO on `wp-admin/admin.php`. 

An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing an XSS payload that is reflected verbatim into the HTML response. When an authenticated administrator visits the link, arbitrary JavaScript executes in the admin browser context. 

Impact includes session hijacking, credential theft, or privilege escalation. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1), CWE-79. Remediation requires updating to 7.10.43 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first requests the site root and uses an internal matcher to confirm the wp-google-maps plugin is installed (presence of "/wp-content/plugins/wp-google-maps" string in body). It then sends a GET request to the crafted path `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin/admin.php/'\"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>?page=wp-google-maps-menu&action=foo` and verifies the payload is reflected unsanitized in the response body, alongside HTTP 200 status and text/html content-type.
