## Vulnerability
D-Link DIR-600M routers on firmware 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, and 3.06 suffer from authentication bypass (CWE-306). Unauthenticated attackers can directly access sensitive pages such as `/wan.htm`, disclosing WAN configuration details (including PPPoE information) that can be leveraged to modify router data fields and settings. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Impact includes unauthorized access to router settings and potential network compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues a raw unauthenticated GET request to `/wan.htm` (with Host and Origin headers) and confirms the vulnerability if the response status is 200 and the body contains the word "/PPPoE/".
