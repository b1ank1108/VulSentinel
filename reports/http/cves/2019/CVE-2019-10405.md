affected_product: Jenkins
severity: medium
authentication: none

affected_versions: Jenkins through 2.196, LTS 2.176.3 and earlier
preconditions: /whoAmI/ URL exposed or accessible via XSS
poc_classification: info-leak

## Vulnerability
Jenkins through 2.196 and LTS through 2.176.3 prints the value of HttpOnly-marked cookies (including JSESSIONID) directly in the HTML body of the /whoAmI/ endpoint. This information disclosure enables session-cookie theft, leading to session hijacking, unauthorized access, and potential data breaches when the page is directly reachable or combined with an XSS vector. CVSS 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N); CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs two unauthenticated raw GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/whoAmI/`. It matches on response headers containing `text/html` AND `x-jenkins` (case-insensitive), HTTP 200 status, and the second response body containing both the literal strings `Cookie` and `JSESSIONID`. It additionally extracts the `x_jenkins` header value as evidence of the vulnerable Jenkins instance.
