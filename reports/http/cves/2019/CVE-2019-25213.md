## Vulnerability
The Advanced Access Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated arbitrary file read (path traversal) in versions up to and including 5.9.8.1 due to insufficient validation on the `aam-media` parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to read any file on the server, including sensitive files such as `wp-config.php`.

**Impact**: Unauthenticated attackers can read sensitive files like `wp-config.php`, leading to information disclosure and potential further exploitation.  
**CVSS**: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE**: CWE-264

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the vulnerability by sending a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=aam-media-load&aam-media=/wp-config.php` and matching on `status_code == 200` AND `contains_all(body, 'DB_NAME','DB_USER','DB_PASSWORD')`.
