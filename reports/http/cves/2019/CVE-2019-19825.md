## Vulnerability
TOTOLINK/Realtek SDK based routers contain a CAPTCHA bypass vulnerability (CVE-2019-19825) in the login endpoint. An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve the CAPTCHA verification text via a POST request to `/boafrm/formLogin` using JSON payload `{"topicurl":"setting/getSanvas"}`. This enables brute-forcing of administrative credentials using Basic Authentication, leading to full device compromise.

CVSS 9.8 (Critical). CWE-287: Improper Authentication.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single raw POST request to `/boafrm/formLogin` with the specified JSON payload and matches on responses where:
- Status code is 200
- Content-Type contains "text/html"
- Content length is exactly 4
- Body matches regex `^[A-Za-z0-9]{4}$` (the CAPTCHA code)

This confirms the endpoint leaks the CAPTCHA, indicating the bypass is possible.
