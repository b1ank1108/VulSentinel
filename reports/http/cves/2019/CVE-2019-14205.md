## Vulnerability

WordPress Nevma Adaptive Images plugin before 0.6.67 allows remote unauthenticated attackers to retrieve arbitrary files via the `adaptive-images-settings[source_file]` parameter in `adaptive-images-script.php`. This is a path-traversal / local file inclusion flaw (CWE-22).

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5 High).  
Impact: disclosure of sensitive server files (e.g., `wp-config.php` containing DB_NAME / DB_PASSWORD), which may lead to full compromise or RCE.  
Remediation: update to 0.6.67 or later or apply vendor patch.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/adaptive-images/adaptive-images-script.php?adaptive-images-settings[source_file]=../../../wp-config.php` and confirms success if the response is HTTP 200 and the body contains both "DB_NAME" and "DB_PASSWORD".
