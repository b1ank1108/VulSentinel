## Vulnerability
eMerge E3 (Linear eMerge E3-Series firmware 1.00-06 from Nortek Control) is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution via OS command injection (CWE-78) in the `ReaderNo` parameter of `/card_scan.php`. The endpoint fails to sanitize backtick-enclosed input, allowing arbitrary command execution.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 10.0).

Description: Linear eMerge E3-Series devices are susceptible to remote code execution vulnerabilities.  
Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.  
Remediation: Apply the latest security patch or update to a non-vulnerable version of eMerge E3.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the vulnerability by sending a first raw GET request to `/card_scan.php?No=30&ReaderNo=\`cat /etc/passwd > {{rand_text_alpha(10)}}.txt\`` (injecting a backtick command that writes the system passwd file to the web root), followed by a second GET to retrieve `/{{rand_file}}.txt`. It confirms success with an `and` matcher requiring HTTP 200 status and regex match `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body.
