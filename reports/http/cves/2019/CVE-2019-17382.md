## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-17382 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability affecting Zabbix versions through 4.4. The vulnerability exists in the dashboard view functionality accessible via `zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view&dashboardid=1`. An attacker can bypass the login page entirely and directly access the dashboard interface without providing any credentials. Once authenticated anonymously, the attacker can create various elements including Dashboards, Reports, Screens, and Maps. These created elements become accessible to other legitimate users and administrators, potentially leading to information disclosure, social engineering attacks, or further exploitation vectors. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) with a CVSS score of 9.1, indicating high confidentiality and integrity impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a two-stage detection process:

1. **Initial Discovery**: The template first attempts to identify a Zabbix installation by sending GET requests to common Zabbix paths (`/`, `/zabbix.php`, `/zabbix/zabbix.php`). It confirms the presence of Zabbix by checking for characteristic strings in the response body such as "zabbix-logo", "zabbix sia", or specific title patterns.

2. **Vulnerability Verification**: Once a Zabbix instance is identified, the template attempts to access the dashboard view endpoint (`zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view&dashboardid=<id>`) without any authentication credentials. It uses a clusterbomb attack with multiple path variations and dashboard IDs from a wordlist. The vulnerability is confirmed if the response contains `<title>Dashboard</title>` and returns a 200 status code, indicating successful unauthenticated access to the dashboard interface.

The template does not perform any destructive actions but verifies that authentication can be bypassed to access protected dashboard functionality.
