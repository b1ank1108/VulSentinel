## Vulnerability
PHPSHE 1.7 is affected by an unauthenticated SQL injection in `include/plugin/payment/alipay/pay.php` via the unsanitized `id` parameter. No authentication is required. The flaw permits execution of arbitrary SQL commands (CWE-89), with CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Impacts include full data theft, modification, or deletion from the backend database.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `/include/plugin/payment/alipay/pay.php` with a crafted `id` payload (`pay where 1=1 union select 1,2,CONCAT(md5(999999999)),4,...#`) that injects a known MD5 value via UNION SELECT. It matches the exact MD5 hash string in the response body to confirm the parameter is injectable and that attacker-controlled data can be returned in the HTTP response.
