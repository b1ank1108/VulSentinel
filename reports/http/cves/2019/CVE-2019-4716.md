## Vulnerability
IBM Planning Analytics versions 2.0.0 through 2.0.8 are vulnerable to a configuration overwrite that allows an unauthenticated user to login as "admin", and then execute code as root or SYSTEM via TM1 scripting. Impact includes full system compromise (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, CWE-94).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce
The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` (following up to 2 host redirects), matches on `status_code == 200` and body containing "IBM Planning Analytics" or "IBM Cognos TM1", extracts version via regex `var appVersion = "([0-9.]+)";` on the body, and evaluates `compare_versions(version, '>= 2.0.0') && compare_versions(version, '<= 2.0.8')`. It performs passive version fingerprinting to identify instances vulnerable to the described RCE.
