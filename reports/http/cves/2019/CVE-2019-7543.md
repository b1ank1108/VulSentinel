## Vulnerability
KindEditor 4.1.11 (kindsoft) contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability via the `content1` parameter in `php/demo.php` (or `/kindeditor/php/demo.php`). User input is reflected unsanitized in the HTTP response body.

Classification: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1); CWE-79.

Impact: Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context, enabling session hijacking, page defacement, or theft of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, local storage).

Remediation: Upgrade to a patched version of KindEditor or apply vendor security patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a POST request (with fallback path) using `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and body `content1=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>&button=%E6%8F%90%E4%BA%A4%E5%86%85%E5%AE%B9`. It verifies the vulnerability if the exact unsanitized payload string appears in the response body, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and the status is 200. This confirms reflection of attacker-controlled JavaScript without authentication or out-of-band interaction.
