## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-16525 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WordPress Checklist plugin versions prior to 1.1.9. The vulnerability exists in the `checklist-icon.php` file where the `fill` parameter is not properly sanitized or filtered before being reflected in the HTTP response. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the context of a victim's browser when they visit a specially crafted URL. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity), requiring user interaction but no authentication to exploit.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-step detection process:

1. **Plugin Presence Check**: Sends a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/checklist/readme.txt` to verify the Checklist plugin is installed by checking for the presence of both "Checklist" and "Tags:" strings in the response.

2. **XSS Vulnerability Verification**: If the plugin is detected, sends a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/checklist/images/checklist-icon.php` with a malicious payload in the `fill` parameter: `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. The template verifies the vulnerability by checking that:
   - The injected payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` is reflected in the response body
   - The response Content-Type header is `text/html`
   - The HTTP status code is 200

The template uses a harmless proof-of-concept payload that would trigger a JavaScript alert displaying the document domain, demonstrating that arbitrary JavaScript can be injected and executed.
