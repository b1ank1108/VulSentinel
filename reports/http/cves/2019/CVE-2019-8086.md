## Vulnerability
Adobe Experience Manager 6.5, 6.4, 6.3 and 6.2 are susceptible to XML external entity injection. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, server-side request forgery, and potential remote code execution.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template sends two raw POST requests with hardcoded admin:admin Basic Auth. The first creates a resource using `sling:resourceType=fd/af/components/guideContainer`. The second submits a `guidePrefillXml` containing `<afData>ABC</afData>` to `.af.internalsubmit.json`. It matches for reflection of the XML payload in the body (`<afData>ABC<afBoundData/>`), `application/json` Content-Type header, and HTTP 200 status to confirm vulnerable XML processing.
