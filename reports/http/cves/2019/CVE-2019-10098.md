## Vulnerability
Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0–2.4.39 contains an open redirect flaw (CWE-601) in mod_rewrite. Self-referential redirects can be tricked by encoded newlines (`%0A`/`%0D`) inside the request URL, causing the server to issue a Location header to an attacker-chosen external domain instead of the intended target. CVSS 3.1 score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Successful exploitation enables phishing or malware distribution via crafted links. Fixed in 2.4.40+.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues one GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.interact.sh` and inspects the `Location` response header with a regex that matches any redirect containing the interact.sh domain (including variations with slashes or encoding). A positive match confirms the mod_rewrite rule was fooled into an arbitrary external redirect.
