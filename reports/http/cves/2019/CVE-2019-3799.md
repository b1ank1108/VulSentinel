## Vulnerability
Spring Cloud Config Server versions 2.1.x prior to 2.1.2, 2.0.x prior to 2.0.4, 1.4.x prior to 1.4.6, and older unsupported versions are vulnerable to local file inclusion. The server allows applications to serve arbitrary configuration files, enabling directory traversal attacks through specially crafted URLs.

**CVSS Metrics**: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 6.5)  
**CWE-ID**: CWE-22  
**Impact**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or sensitive information disclosure.  
**Remediation**: Upgrade to a patched version of Spring Cloud Config Server or apply the recommended security patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/test/pathtraversal/master/..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f../etc/passwd` and verifies success by matching HTTP status 200 together with the regex `root:.*:0:0:` anywhere in the response body (confirming /etc/passwd contents were returned).
