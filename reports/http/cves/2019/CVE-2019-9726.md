## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-9726 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability affecting eQ-3 AG Homematic CCU3 firmware version 3.43.15 and earlier. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files from the device's filesystem without authentication. Attackers with network access to the web interface can exploit this flaw to access sensitive system files. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) with a CVSS v3.0 score of 7.5 (High severity), indicating high confidentiality impact with no authentication required and low attack complexity.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by attempting to exploit the path traversal flaw to read the `/etc/passwd` file. It sends a GET request to `/.%00./.%00./etc/passwd`, using null byte injection (`%00`) combined with directory traversal sequences to bypass path restrictions. The template confirms successful exploitation by checking for:

1. The presence of typical Unix password file entries matching patterns like `root:.*:0:0:` or `bin:.*:0:0:` in the response body
2. An HTTP 200 status code indicating successful file retrieval

Both conditions must be satisfied for a positive detection, confirming that the attacker can read arbitrary system files through the web interface.
