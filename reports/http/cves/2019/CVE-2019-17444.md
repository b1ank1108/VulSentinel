## Vulnerability

Jfrog Artifactory versions prior to 6.17.0 ship with default administrative credentials (username: "admin", password: "password") and do not enforce password changes upon initial setup. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to gain complete administrative access to the Artifactory instance over the network. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-521 (Weak Password Requirements) with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating critical severity. Successful exploitation grants attackers full control over the artifact repository, including the ability to read, modify, or delete artifacts, manipulate build configurations, and potentially pivot to connected systems.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template attempts to authenticate to the Jfrog Artifactory web interface using default credentials. It sends a POST request to the `/ui/auth/login` endpoint (testing both root path and `/artifactory` subdirectory) with a JSON payload containing the default username "admin" and password "password". The template uses a clusterbomb attack to test multiple path variations.

Detection is confirmed when:
1. The server responds with HTTP 200 status
2. The response body contains both `"name":"admin"` and `"admin":true`, indicating successful authentication with administrative privileges

The template stops at the first successful match, confirming the presence of unchanged default credentials that allow complete authentication bypass.
