## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-8449 is an information disclosure vulnerability affecting Atlassian Jira versions prior to 8.4.0. The vulnerability exists in the `/rest/api/latest/groupuserpicker` REST API endpoint, which improperly exposes user enumeration functionality without adequate access controls (CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function). An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this endpoint to enumerate valid usernames within the Jira instance by querying the groupuserpicker resource with arbitrary parameters. This information disclosure can facilitate subsequent attacks by providing attackers with valid user accounts for credential stuffing, targeted phishing, or other social engineering attacks. The CVSS v3.1 score is 5.3 (Medium), with the attack vector being network-based, requiring low complexity, no privileges, and no user interaction.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated GET request to the `/rest/api/latest/groupuserpicker` endpoint with parameters designed to retrieve a large result set (`query=1&maxResults=50000&showAvatar=true`). The template verifies the vulnerability by checking for two conditions:

1. The response body contains the JSON structure `{"users":{"users":`, indicating that user data is being returned
2. The HTTP response status code is 200, confirming successful access to the endpoint

A successful match indicates that the endpoint is accessible without authentication and returns user information, confirming the presence of the information disclosure vulnerability. The template does not attempt to extract or display actual usernames; it only verifies that the vulnerable endpoint is accessible and returns user data in the expected format.
