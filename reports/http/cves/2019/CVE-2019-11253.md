## Vulnerability
Kubernetes API Server is vulnerable to a YAML/JSON parsing denial-of-service (Billion Laughs attack). A remote unauthenticated attacker can submit a specially crafted YAML or JSON payload that triggers exponential entity expansion during parsing, resulting in massive memory/CPU consumption and complete API server crash or unavailability.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (score 7.5)  
CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)  
Impact: full service disruption of the Kubernetes control plane.  
Remediation: upgrade to v1.13.12+, v1.14.8+, v1.15.5+, v1.16.2+ (fixed input validation).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: dos

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/apis/authorization.k8s.io/v1/selfsubjectaccessreviews` with `Content-Type: application/yaml` (empty body) and matches on the response body containing all three strings `"Invalid value"`, `"FieldValueInvalid"`, and `"422"` to confirm the endpoint is reachable and performs YAML parsing — the exact condition required for the Billion Laughs DoS payload to be effective.
