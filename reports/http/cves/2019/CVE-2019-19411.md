## Vulnerability
Huawei Firewall (USG9500 models) is affected by a local file inclusion vulnerability that enables information leakage. Specific impacted versions: V500R001C30SPC100, V500R001C30SPC200, V500R001C30SPC600, V500R001C60SPC500, V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200. The flaw stems from improper processing of the initialization vector in a specific encryption algorithm, allowing an attacker with network access to diminish confidentiality and recover protected information. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 3.7, Low; CWE-665). Impact includes potential exposure of sensitive system files such as /etc/passwd via path traversal.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/umweb/../etc/passwd` and verifies exploitation success via three matchers: regex `root:[x*]:0:0:` present in the response body (confirming /etc/passwd contents leaked), `application/octet-stream` word in the response header, and HTTP status code 200.
