## Vulnerability
WPS Hide Login WordPress plugin versions <= 1.5.2.2 (before 1.5.3) contains an `action=confirmaction` protection bypass. Attackers can bypass the plugin’s security checks that hide/protect the default `wp-login.php` page by sending a specially crafted request, potentially enabling unauthorized access attempts.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template uses a two-step HTTP flow to detect the bypass:  
1. GET to `{{BaseURL}}` (internal matcher only) confirming the plugin via the string “wps-hide” in the response body.  
2. GET to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-login.php?SECUPRESSaction=confirmaction` matching on status_code == 200 AND presence of “Username or Email Address</label>” AND “wp-login-lost-password” in the body.
