## Vulnerability
Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.39 are vulnerable to a limited cross-site scripting issue affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This is only exploitable on servers set up with proxying enabled but misconfigured such that the Proxy Error page is displayed.

Successful exploitation allows injection of malicious HTML or execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context, potentially enabling session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

CVSS: 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE: CWE-79  
EPSS: 0.83092 (99.236th percentile)  

Remediation: Upgrade to Apache HTTP Server 2.4.40 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/%5cgoogle.com/evil.html` (crafted to trigger a proxy error) and verifies the response contains the string "Proxy Error" together with the exact malformed anchor `<a href="/\google.com/evil.html">`, confirming failure to properly escape the URL in the error-page link.
