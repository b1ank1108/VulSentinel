## Vulnerability

WordPress Yuzo Related Posts plugin versions before 5.12.94 contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The vulnerability stems from a logic flaw where the plugin incorrectly uses the `is_admin()` function, which only verifies that a request is for an admin page rather than verifying the requester is an authenticated admin user. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious payloads into plugin settings, specifically the `yuzo_related_post_css_and_style` setting. The injected scripts are then executed in the context of users' browsers when they view affected pages.

The CVSS v3.0 score is 6.1 (Medium), with the vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation requiring no privileges but user interaction, with changed scope and low confidentiality and integrity impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: state-change

The template performs a two-step detection process:

1. **Injection Step**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=yuzo-related-post` with a payload that attempts to inject XSS code into the `yuzo_related_post_css_and_style` parameter: `</style><script>alert(0);</script>`

2. **Verification Step**: Sends a GET request to the homepage (`/`) to check if the injected payload is reflected in the response

The template confirms the vulnerability by verifying:
- The injected script tag `<script>alert(0);</script>` appears in the homepage response body
- The response content-type header contains `text/html`

This demonstrates that an unauthenticated attacker can successfully modify plugin settings and inject persistent XSS payloads that affect all site visitors.
