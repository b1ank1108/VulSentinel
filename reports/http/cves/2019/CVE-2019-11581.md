## Vulnerability
Jira Server and Data Center is susceptible to a server-side template injection vulnerability via the ContactAdministrators and SendBulkMail actions. An attacker is able to remotely execute code on systems that run a vulnerable version of Jira Server or Data Center. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8). CWE-74. Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution, compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/secure/ContactAdministrators!default.jspa` and applies AND matchers on the response body: presence of "Contact Site Administrators", negative match on "has not yet configured this contact form", and OR regex patterns matching vulnerable version strings (e.g. `\(v4\.4\.`, `\(v7\.[012345789]\.`, `\(v8\.0\.[0-2]` etc.).
