## Vulnerability
WordPress Woody Ad Snippets plugin (formerly known via slug insert-php) versions prior to 2.2.5 is vulnerable to unauthenticated options import via `admin/includes/class.import.snippet.php`. An attacker can import settings containing an XSS payload that is stored and later triggers remote code execution.

**Impact**: Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access, data theft, and remote code execution.  
**CVSS 3.1**: 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE**: CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)  
**Remediation**: Update to 2.2.5 or later / apply vendor patch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs a non-intrusive version fingerprint: issues a GET request to the publicly accessible `/wp-content/plugins/insert-php/readme.txt` file, requires HTTP 200 status, confirms the body contains both "Changelog" and "Woody ad snippets" strings, and ensures the patched version string "2.2.5" is absent.
