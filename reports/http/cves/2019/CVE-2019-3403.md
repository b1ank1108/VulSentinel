## Vulnerability
Jira before version 7.13.3, from version 8.0.0 before version 8.0.4, and from version 8.1.0 before version 8.1.1 contains an incorrect authorization check in the `/rest/api/2/user/picker` REST endpoint (CWE-863). An unauthenticated remote attacker can enumerate usernames via this resource (CVSS 5.3, PR:N, C:L). Impact includes exposure of sensitive user data, potential data breaches, and unauthorized actions inside Jira instances.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends one unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/rest/api/2/user/picker?query=` and confirms exploitation conditions with an AND matcher set: `Content-Type` contains `application/json`, body contains `"users":` or `"usuario":`, plus `"total":` and `"header":`, status is 200 or 404, and body does not contain `"total":0`. Positive match indicates the endpoint returns user enumeration results without any authorization enforcement.
