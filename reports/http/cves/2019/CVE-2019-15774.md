## Vulnerability
The ND Booking WordPress plugin < 2.5 is affected by an unauthenticated options change vulnerability. Unauthenticated attackers can modify arbitrary WordPress plugin options via the `nd_booking_import_settings_php_function` AJAX action (e.g. enabling development mode by setting `nd_booking_plugin_dev_mode`). Impact includes configuration tampering that may facilitate further attacks or disrupt site functionality. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-601. Remediation: update to version 2.5 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first issues an internal GET to `/wp-content/plugins/nd-booking/readme.txt`, extracts the Stable tag version via regex, and confirms `contains(body, 'Booking WP plugin') && compare_versions(version, '< 2.5')`. It then sends a raw unauthenticated GET to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=nd_booking_import_settings_php_function&nd_booking_value_import_settings=nd_booking_plugin_dev_mode%5Bnd_booking_option_value%5D1` and matches on 200 status plus response body containing either "Updated option \"nd_booking_plugin_dev_mode\" with the same value." or "Updated option \"nd_booking_plugin_dev_mode\" with 1.".
