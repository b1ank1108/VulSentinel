## Vulnerability
WP Live Chat Support WordPress plugin (by 3CX) <= 8.0.27 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting. The plugin fails to sanitize the `wplc_custom_js` (and related email transcript/GDPR fields) when processed via the unauthenticated `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` save-settings action. Injected JavaScript is stored server-side and later rendered unsanitized on the site frontend (homepage and other pages). CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1), CWE-79. Exploitation requires no credentials; any visitor to the affected site executes the payload in their browser.

**Impact**: Session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or arbitrary client-side code execution in victim context.  
**Remediation**: Update to 8.0.27 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first issues an unauthenticated POST to `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` containing a full settings payload with `wplc_custom_js=console.log(document.domain)` (plus dozens of other plugin options) to modify server-side configuration. A follow-up GET to `{{BaseURL}}` then confirms the payload is embedded verbatim inside the returned HTML (`<script>console.log(document.domain)</script>` present, `text/html` content-type, 200 OK). The first request matcher simply verifies HTTP 200 + empty body (internal); the second matcher confirms successful storage and reflection of the malicious JS.
