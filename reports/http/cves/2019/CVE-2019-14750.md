## Vulnerability
osTicket is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in the setup/install.php script. The firstname and lastname fields lack input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript payloads during the installation process. The payload is persisted and executes in the administrator's browser context upon viewing affected pages (e.g., settings.php), potentially enabling session hijacking or data theft.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1/Medium). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template verifies the stored XSS by simulating a full installation and admin login flow:
- POSTs to /upload/setup/install.php with random user details and XSS payload (`"><img src=x onerror=alert(1);>`) embedded in fname and lname fields.
- GETs /upload/scp/login.php to extract __CSRFToken__.
- POSTs login credentials to /upload/scp/login.php.
- GETs /upload/scp/settings.php and matches for the unsanitized payload in the response body (plus page-specific strings) to confirm storage and lack of escaping.
