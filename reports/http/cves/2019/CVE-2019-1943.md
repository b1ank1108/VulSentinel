## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-1943 is an open redirect vulnerability affecting the Web UI of Cisco Small Business 200, 300, and 500 Series Switches. The vulnerability stems from improper validation of URL redirects (CWE-601), allowing an attacker to craft malicious URLs that redirect users to arbitrary external websites. When a user clicks on a specially crafted link, the switch's web interface redirects them to an attacker-controlled site without proper validation. This can be leveraged for phishing attacks, credential harvesting, or malware distribution by exploiting the trust users place in legitimate Cisco device URLs. The vulnerability requires no authentication to exploit and has a CVSS v3.0 score of 6.1 (Medium severity) with the vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation with low complexity but requiring user interaction.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending an HTTP GET request with the Host header set to `interact.sh` (a domain used for testing redirects). The template verifies the presence of the vulnerability through three conditions:

1. **Server identification**: Checks if the response contains the `GoAhead-Webs` server header, which is characteristic of the web server used in these Cisco switches
2. **Redirect validation**: Uses a regex pattern to detect if the Location header redirects to the interact.sh domain with a specific path pattern (`https?://interact.sh/cs[\w]+/`)
3. **HTTP status**: Confirms the response returns a 302 (redirect) status code

The template does not exploit the vulnerability destructively but rather demonstrates that the device will honor arbitrary Host headers and redirect to external domains, confirming the open redirect condition exists.
