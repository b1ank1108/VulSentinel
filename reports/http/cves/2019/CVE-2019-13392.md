## Vulnerability
MindPalette NateMail 3.0.15 suffers from reflected cross-site scripting. A specially crafted POST request to `/NateMail.php` with a non-integer `recipient` value (the array is keyed by integers by default) causes the application to reflect the raw input unsanitized into the HTML response body. 

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79. Successful exploitation allows JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context, enabling data theft, session hijacking, or page defacement. Remediation requires upgrading beyond 3.0.15.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues one raw POST request containing `recipient=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and asserts two conditions: the exact payload string must appear verbatim in the response body **and** the `Content-Type` header must contain `text/html`. This verifies unsanitized reflection of attacker-controlled input.
