## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-7315 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability affecting Genie Access WIP3BVAF WISH IP 3MP IR Auto Focus Bullet Camera devices through version 3.X. The vulnerability exists in the web interface and allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the device's filesystem using directory traversal techniques. The flaw is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) and has a CVSS v3.0 score of 7.5 (High severity), with an attack vector that is network-based, requires low complexity, no privileges, and no user interaction. The vulnerability enables attackers to access sensitive system files such as /etc/shadow, potentially exposing password hashes and other confidential information stored on the camera device.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an HTTP GET request to the camera's web interface with a path traversal payload: `{{BaseURL}}/../../../../../etc/passwd`. The detection mechanism verifies successful exploitation through two conditions: (1) the response body contains a regex pattern matching `root:.*:0:0:`, which indicates the presence of the root user entry from the Unix passwd file, and (2) the HTTP response status code is 200, confirming successful file retrieval. This probe demonstrates the ability to read system files outside the intended web root directory, confirming the presence of the local file inclusion vulnerability.
