## Vulnerability
Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce WordPress plugin (and Abandoned Cart Pro) is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting via multiple parameters due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping (up to and including 5.1.3 for Lite). Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into user input that execute when administrators view the dashboard. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 7.2). Fixed in 5.2.0.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template performs a passive version fingerprint by issuing a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-abandoned-cart/readme.txt`, extracts the "Stable tag" via regex, and evaluates the DSL condition `compare_versions(version, "< 5.2.0") && contains(body, "Abandoned Cart") && status_code == 200`.
