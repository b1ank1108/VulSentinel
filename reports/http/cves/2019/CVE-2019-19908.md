## Vulnerability

phpMyChat-Plus version 1.98 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the password reset functionality. The vulnerability exists in the `pass_reset.php` file, where the `pmc_username` parameter is not properly sanitized before being reflected in the HTML response. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `pmc_username` parameter, which will be executed in the context of a victim's browser when they visit the link. This allows arbitrary script execution, potentially enabling session hijacking, credential theft, website defacement, or other malicious actions performed with the victim's privileges.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). The attack vector is network-based, requires low attack complexity, no privileges, but does require user interaction (the victim must click the malicious link). The scope is changed, meaning the vulnerable component impacts resources beyond its security scope.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this XSS vulnerability by sending a GET request to `/plus/pass_reset.php` with a crafted `pmc_username` parameter containing an XSS payload: `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. 

The detection verifies the vulnerability through three conditions:
1. The response body contains the reflected payload string `username = "</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`, confirming the input is reflected without proper encoding
2. The response Content-Type header is `text/html`, indicating the payload is rendered in an HTML context
3. The HTTP response status is 200, confirming the page processed the request successfully

This is a non-destructive detection method that confirms the presence of the XSS vulnerability by checking for the reflected malicious input in the server response without actually executing the JavaScript in a browser context.
