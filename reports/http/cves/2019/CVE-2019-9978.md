## Vulnerability
WordPress Social Warfare (and Pro) plugin <3.5.3 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) via the `swp_url` parameter in `wp-admin/admin-post.php?swp_debug=load_options`. 

Unauthenticated attackers can supply malicious URLs leading to settings changes and persistent XSS executed in administrator context. Potential impacts: session hijacking, privilege escalation.

CVSS 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template fingerprints the Social Warfare plugin via its readme.txt (matching the word "Social Warfare"), then issues a request to the admin-post.php endpoint with `swp_url=http://{{interactsh-url}}`. It matches on the resulting HTTP interaction callback from the target server to confirm the parameter is accepted and processed, indicating the underlying settings modification flaw.
