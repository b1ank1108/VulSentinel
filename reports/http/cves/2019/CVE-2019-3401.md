## Vulnerability
Atlassian Jira before version 7.13.3 and from version 8.0.0 before version 8.1.1 suffers from incorrect authorization (CWE-863) on the ManageFilters.jspa resource. A remote attacker can enumerate usernames via a flawed authorization check, enabling disclosure of sensitive information, potential data modification, or unauthorized operations. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/secure/ManageFilters.jspa?filter=popular&filterView=popular` and confirms vulnerability by matching both `<span data-filter-field="owner-full-name">` (exposing filter owner usernames) and `<title>Manage Filters - Jira</title>` in the response.
