## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-12962 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in LiveZilla Server version 8.0.1.0. The vulnerability exists due to improper sanitization of the Accept-Language HTTP header in the mobile interface endpoint. When a malicious Accept-Language header value is sent to `/mobile/index.php`, the server reflects the unsanitized input directly into JavaScript code within the response, specifically into the `detectedLanguage` variable. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser session.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). The attack vector is network-based with low attack complexity, requires no privileges but does require user interaction, and has a changed scope with low confidentiality and integrity impact.

Successful exploitation could allow attackers to steal session cookies, capture credentials, perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users, or redirect victims to malicious sites.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to `/mobile/index.php` with a crafted Accept-Language header containing the payload `;alert(document.domain)//`. The template verifies the vulnerability by checking for three conditions:

1. The response body contains the exact string `var detectedLanguage = ';alert(document.domain)//';"`, confirming that the malicious payload was reflected unsanitized into the JavaScript code
2. The response Content-Type header is `text/html`, indicating the payload is rendered in an HTML context
3. The HTTP response status is 200, confirming successful page rendering

The presence of the injected payload in the JavaScript variable demonstrates that user-controlled input from the Accept-Language header is directly embedded into executable JavaScript without proper encoding or sanitization, proving the XSS vulnerability exists.
