## Vulnerability
Popup-Maker WordPress plugin suffers from broken authentication (CVE-2019-17574, CWE-639). An unauthenticated attacker can partially control arguments passed to the `do_action` function, allowing invocation of restricted `popmake_` or `pum_` methods. Demonstrated impact: full control over content and delivery of `popmake-system-info.txt` (support debug text file).  
Impact: unauthenticated attackers can gain administrative access to the WordPress site.  
CVSS 3.1: 9.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).  
Fixed in version 1.8.12.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a two-request sequence to verify the flaw:  
- GET `/?pum_action=tools_page_tab_system_info` (expects "Popup Maker Configuration" and "Webserver Configuration" in response body).  
- POST `/` with `popmake_action=popup_sysinfo&popmake-sysinfo=CVE-2019-17574` (expects the injected CVE string echoed back).  
Matchers confirm successful invocation of the privileged action without any authentication.
