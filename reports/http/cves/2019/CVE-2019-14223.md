## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-14223 is an open redirect vulnerability in Alfresco Share affecting versions before 5.2.6, 6.0.N, and 6.1.N. The vulnerability exists in the login functionality and can be exploited via a crafted POST request to the `/share/page/dologin` endpoint. An attacker can manipulate the redirect parameter to send users to arbitrary external domains after a login attempt. This can be leveraged for phishing attacks, credential harvesting, or to trick users into visiting malicious websites. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site) with a CVSS score of 6.1, requiring user interaction but no authentication to exploit.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a POST request to `/share/page/dologin` with a malicious redirect parameter. The request includes:
- A `failure` parameter set to an Interactsh callback URL (`:interact.sh`)
- Invalid credentials (`username=baduser&password=badpass`)
- A `success` parameter set to a legitimate path

The template verifies the vulnerability by checking if the HTTP response Location header redirects to the attacker-controlled Interactsh domain. The regex matcher looks for the `interact.sh` domain in the Location header, confirming that the application improperly validates redirect URLs and allows redirection to external, untrusted sites. This demonstrates that an attacker can craft URLs that redirect users to arbitrary domains, enabling phishing and social engineering attacks.
