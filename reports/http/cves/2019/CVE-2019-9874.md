## Vulnerability
Sitecore Experience Platform suffers from a deserialization of untrusted data flaw (CVE-2019-9874, CWE-502) enabling remote code execution. An attacker can submit maliciously crafted serialized objects via a crafted request to vulnerable Sitecore endpoints (description references `/sitecore/shell/Applications/Layouts/IDE.aspx`), resulting in arbitrary code execution and potential full system compromise.

CVSS v3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Tagged KEV.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a single POST request to `/sitecore/shell/Applications/Security/CreateNewUser/CreateNewUser.aspx` (form-urlencoded) containing `__CSRFCOOKIE={{randstr}}` and `__CSRFTOKEN` populated with a base64-encoded Java gadget that triggers DNS interaction to `https://{{interactsh-url}}`. It detects the vulnerable deserializer if the response status is 500 and the body contains both `PotentialCsrfException` and `deserialization` (case-insensitive).

(Note: description cites `/sitecore/shell/Applications/Layouts/IDE.aspx` as the trigger endpoint; template uses an alternative vector exercising the same deserialization path.)
