## Vulnerability

WordPress Hero Maps Premium plugin versions 2.2.1 and earlier contains an unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The issue is due to insufficient sanitization of the `p` parameter in `wp-content/plugins/hmapsprem/views/dashboard/index.php`. Exploitation requires no authentication and can lead to malicious script execution in the victim's browser context (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/hmapsprem/views/dashboard/index.php?p=/wp-content/plugins/hmapsprem/foo"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and checks for reflection of the unsanitized payload string in the response body, combined with HTTP 200 status and text/html Content-Type header. This verifies the reflected XSS condition without requiring user interaction for detection.
