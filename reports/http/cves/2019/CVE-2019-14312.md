## Vulnerability

CVE-2019-14312 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in Aptana Jaxer version 1.0.3.4547. The vulnerability exists in the wikilite source code viewer component, specifically in the `tools/sourceViewer/index.html` endpoint. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the `filename` parameter with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive internal files, potentially leading to information disclosure and data leakage. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) with a CVSS v3.0 score of 6.5 (Medium severity). The attack vector is network-based, requires low attack complexity, and requires low-level privileges but no user interaction.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/tools/sourceViewer/index.html` with a malicious `filename` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (`..%2f` repeated multiple times) to access `/etc/passwd`. The detection mechanism verifies successful exploitation through two conditions:
1. The response body contains a regex pattern matching typical Unix password file entries (`root:.*:0:0:`)
2. The HTTP response status code is 200

This confirms that the application improperly validates the filename parameter and allows reading arbitrary files outside the intended directory, demonstrating a classic local file inclusion vulnerability.
