## Vulnerability
WordPress Page Layout builder plugin v1.9.3 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) in `/wp-content/plugins/page-layout-builder/includes/layout-settings.php`. The `layout_settings_id` GET parameter reflects user-supplied input without sanitization or encoding.  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).  
Successful exploitation allows injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.  
Remediation: Upgrade to version 2.0 or higher.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template uses a two-request HTTP flow. First, a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/page-layout-builder/readme.txt` (internal word matcher for "Page Layout Builder =") confirms plugin presence. Second, a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/page-layout-builder/includes/layout-settings.php?layout_settings_id=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` injects a reflected XSS payload; detection succeeds if the unsanitized string `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` appears in the response body, the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
