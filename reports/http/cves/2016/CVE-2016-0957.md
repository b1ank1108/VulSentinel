## Vulnerability
Adobe AEM Dispatcher before version 4.15 fails to properly implement its URL filter, allowing remote attackers to bypass configured dispatcher rules (allow/deny patterns, path restrictions) via unspecified vectors. This affects Adobe Experience Manager 5.6.1, 6.0.0, and 6.1.0 installations fronted by the vulnerable Dispatcher.  

**Impact**: Attackers can reach paths and endpoints that should be blocked, leading to information disclosure of sensitive AEM internals (OSGi console data, Java runtime details) and potential further compromise.  
**CVSS 3.0**: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  
**Remediation**: Upgrade Dispatcher to 4.15 or newer.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  

The template issues a single unauthenticated-style GET to `{{BaseURL}}/system/console?.css` while supplying `Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4K` (default admin:admin credentials) and confirms exploitation if the response is HTTP 200 and contains the strings "Adobe", "java.lang", and "(Runtime)" (signatures of the exposed Felix/OSGi web console).
