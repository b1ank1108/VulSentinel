## Vulnerability
WordPress HDW Video Gallery plugin (versions 1.2 and earlier) contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in `/wp-content/plugins/hdw-tube/mychannel.php`. The `channel` GET parameter is reflected unsanitized into the HTML response body, enabling an unauthenticated remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of any victim who visits the maliciously crafted URL.  

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1, CWE-79).  
Successful exploitation permits session hijacking via cookie theft, page defacement, or theft of sensitive browser-stored information. The vulnerability is present in any default installation of the plugin on WordPress; no additional configuration or features are required. Fixed in version 1.3.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  

The template uses a two-step HTTP flow to detect the flaw:  
1. Issues `GET /wp-content/plugins/hdw-tube/readme.txt` (internal word matcher for “HDW WordPress Video Gallery” to confirm plugin presence).  
2. Issues `GET {{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/hdw-tube/mychannel.php?channel=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`.  

Matchers require: payload string present verbatim in response body, `Content-Type` containing `text/html`, and HTTP 200 status. No credentials, no external callbacks, and no destructive actions are performed; the probe solely verifies unsanitized reflection of the XSS payload.
