## Vulnerability
The remoting module in Jenkins before 2.32 and LTS before 2.19.3 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized Java object that triggers an LDAP query to an attacker-controlled server. Impact includes full server compromise, access to all build systems, and exposure of secrets. CVSS 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template executes custom Ruby code over TCP sockets against the target host/port:  
1. Sends POST /cli (Side: download) and keeps the socket open.  
2. Sends POST /cli (Side: upload) with a Base64-encoded payload containing a malicious serialized Java object embedding an interactsh-controlled URL.  
3. Reads the download socket response.  
Detection matches if response contains `hudson.remoting.UserRequest` AND a DNS callback is observed on interactsh.
