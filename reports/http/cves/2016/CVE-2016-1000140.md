## Vulnerability
WordPress New Year Firework plugin <=1.1.9 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `text` GET parameter passed to `/wp-content/plugins/new-year-firework/firework/index.php` is reflected unsanitized into the HTML output. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing an arbitrary JavaScript payload (e.g. `"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`) that executes in the victim's browser in the context of the vulnerable site. This enables session/cookie theft, page defacement, or further client-side attacks. Impact is limited to users who click the link (UI:R). CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs an internal GET to `/wp-content/plugins/new-year-firework/readme.txt` and matches the string "New Year Firework =" to confirm the plugin is present. It then issues a second GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with the encoded reflected-XSS probe `?text=%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`. Detection succeeds when the response body contains the exact unsanitized payload string, the Content-Type header includes `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
