## Vulnerability
Newspaper Theme versions 6.4 to 6.7.1 for WordPress lacked proper options access control through the `td_ajax_update_panel` AJAX action. Unauthenticated attackers can escalate privileges to administrator level, enabling complete site takeover including content manipulation, user management, and potential full compromise.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8) • CWE-269 • Remediation: update to version 6.7.2 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects vulnerable installations by issuing a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/themes/Newspaper/style.css`, confirming HTTP 200 status and the string "Newspaper" in the body, extracting the version with the regex `Version: 		([0-9.]+)`, and validating the range via `compare_versions(version, '>= 6.4', '<= 6.7.1')` DSL matchers.
