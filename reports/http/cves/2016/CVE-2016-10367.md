## Vulnerability
Opsview Monitor Pro is vulnerable to unauthenticated local file inclusion (CWE-22) exploitable via a specially crafted HTTP GET request that bypasses path sanitization with repeated double-encoded `..%252f` sequences targeting the `/monitoring/` endpoint.  

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5).  
Impact: arbitrary sensitive file reads on the server (e.g. /etc/passwd), leading to information disclosure.  
Remediation: upgrade to a fixed release or apply the 2016 security patch for 4.5.x.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends one unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/monitoring/..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd` and confirms success when the response body matches the regex `root:[x*]:0:0` AND the HTTP status is 404.
