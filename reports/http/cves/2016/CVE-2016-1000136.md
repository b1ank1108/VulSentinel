## Vulnerability
WordPress heat-trackr 1.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `heat-trackr_abtest_add.php` via the unsanitized `id` parameter. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the context of an unsuspecting victim's browser. This enables theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, or other client-side attacks. The flaw is present only when the plugin is installed and the endpoint is reachable.

**CVSS:** 6.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
**CWE:** CWE-79  
**Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in victims' browsers, allowing credential theft or impersonation.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to a patched version of the heat-trackr plugin or apply vendor-supplied fixes.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template uses a two-request flow to confirm the vulnerable condition and verify payload reflection:  
1. GET `{{BaseURL}}` (internal matcher checks for the string `/wp-content/plugins/heat-trackr/` to confirm plugin presence).  
2. GET `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/heat-trackr/heat-trackr_abtest_add.php?id=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` with matchers requiring status 200, `text/html` Content-Type, and exact unsanitized payload echoed in the response body.  

This directly tests for reflection of attacker-controlled input, confirming the XSS flaw that enables unauthorized data access (e.g., cookies) in the victim's browser context.
