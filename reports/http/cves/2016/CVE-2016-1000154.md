affected_product: WordPress WHIZZ plugin
severity: medium

external_callback: false
affected_versions: <=1.0.7
preconditions: [WHIZZ plugin installed on a WordPress site]

## Vulnerability
WordPress WHIZZ plugin <=1.0.7 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in `/wp-content/plugins/whizz/plugins/delete-plugin.php` via the unsanitized `plugin` GET parameter. Attacker-controlled input is reflected in the response, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser on the affected site. This enables theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other client-side attacks. 

Description from template: WordPress plugin WHIZZ 1.07 and before contains reflected XSS. Impact: data theft or unauthorized actions. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/whizz/readme.txt` and uses an internal matcher to confirm the WHIZZ plugin is present by checking for the words 'WHIZZ' and 'Tags:'. It then sends a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/whizz/plugins/delete-plugin.php?plugin=%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` and matches for the unsanitized payload reflected in the response body, along with HTTP 200 status and text/html content-type. This verifies the reflected XSS condition.
