## Vulnerability
WordPress e-search plugin versions 1.0 and earlier contain a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in `tmpl/title_az.php` via the `title_az` GET parameter. User input is reflected without sanitization or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser context.

Successful exploitation enables theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, or site defacement. Requires victim interaction with a crafted link.

CVSS: 6.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) | CWE-79

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template first issues an internal GET to `/wp-content/plugins/e-search/readme.txt` and matches for the strings 'Search', 'Tags:', and 'Tested up to:' (AND condition) to confirm plugin presence. It then sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/e-search/tmpl/title_az.php?title_az=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` and verifies the exact unsanitized payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` appears in the response body, Content-Type contains `text/html`, and status code is 200.
