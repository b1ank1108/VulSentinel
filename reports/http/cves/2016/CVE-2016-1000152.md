## Vulnerability
WordPress Tidio-form plugin <=1.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2016-1000152, CWE-79). The `formId` GET parameter in `popup-insert-help.php` is not sanitized and is echoed directly into the HTML output. An attacker can supply a malicious payload that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the context of any visitor (including authenticated users) who opens the crafted link, enabling theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, or site defacement. CVSS 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). No server-side code execution or state change occurs.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues an internal GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/tidio-form/readme.txt` and matches the string `Easy Contact Form Builder =` to confirm plugin presence. It then sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/tidio-form/popup-insert-help.php?formId=%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`, verifying exploitation by checking that the exact unsanitized payload appears in the response body, the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
