## Vulnerability
WordPress Photoxhibit 2.1.8 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in `/wp-content/plugins/photoxhibit/common/inc/pages/build.php` via the unsanitized `gid` GET parameter. Attacker-controlled input is echoed directly into the HTML response without escaping, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of any authenticated or unauthenticated visitor who clicks a crafted link.  

Impact: session hijacking via cookie theft, site defacement, or theft of sensitive information.  
CVSS v3.0: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE: CWE-79  

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  

The template first issues an internal fingerprint request to `/wp-content/plugins/photoxhibit/readme.txt` and confirms the presence of the Photoxhibit component by matching both `PhotoXhibit` and `Tags:` strings. It then sends a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with the breakout payload `gid=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. Detection succeeds when the response body contains the exact unsanitized payload, the `Content-Type` header includes `text/html`, and the status code is 200. This confirms lack of output encoding on the `gid` parameter.
