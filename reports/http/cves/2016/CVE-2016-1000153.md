## Vulnerability
WordPress Tidio Gallery plugin <=1.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The flaw is in `popup-insert-help.php` where the `galleryId` parameter is not sanitized, allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript.

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks (session hijacking, defacement, theft of sensitive information).

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs an internal detection by requesting `/wp-content/plugins/tidio-gallery/readme.txt` and matching for 'Tidio Gallery' and 'Tags:' to confirm plugin presence. It then issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/tidio-gallery/popup-insert-help.php?galleryId=%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` (reflected XSS payload) and checks if the unsanitized payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` appears in the response body, along with text/html content-type and HTTP 200 status.
