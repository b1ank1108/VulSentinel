## Vulnerability
Trend Micro Threat Discovery Appliance 2.6.1062r1 suffers from a directory traversal (CWE-22) flaw when handling the `session_id` cookie. A remote unauthenticated attacker can supply a traversal payload to delete arbitrary files as root, directly enabling authentication bypass or denial of service.  

CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Impact includes full appliance compromise via unauthorized root-level file deletion.  
Remediation requires applying the vendor patch or update.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/cgi-bin/logoff.cgi` embedding the payload `session_id=../../../opt/TrendMicro/MinorityReport/etc/igsa.conf` in the Cookie header. It matches on HTTP 200 status and the string "Memory map" in the response body. This LFI probe verifies the underlying traversal condition that an attacker can weaponize for root file deletion and consequent authentication bypass.
