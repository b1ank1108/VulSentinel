## Vulnerability
WordPress WPSOLR plugin versions 8.6 and before contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the `page` parameter of `/wp-content/plugins/wpsolr-search-engine/classes/extensions/managed-solr-servers/templates/template-my-accounts.php`. Attacker-controlled input is reflected unsanitized into the HTML response, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context when a crafted link is visited (requires user interaction).  

Impact includes theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and performance of actions on behalf of the victim.  

CVSS v3.0: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE: 79  

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues an internal GET to `/wp-content/plugins/wpsolr-search-engine/readme.txt` and matches the string 'WPSOLR Search Engine =' to confirm plugin presence. It then sends a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with the URL-encoded payload `%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` in the `page` parameter. Detection confirms the flaw if the exact injected string `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` appears unescaped in the response body, the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
