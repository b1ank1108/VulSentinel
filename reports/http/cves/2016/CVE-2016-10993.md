## Vulnerability
WordPress ScoreMe theme (framework: wordpress, vendor: scoreme_project, product: scoreme) contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability via the `s` search parameter. Any version through 2016-04-01 is affected. An attacker can craft a malicious URL that injects arbitrary JavaScript executed in the victim's browser context on the affected site. This enables theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, page defacement, or exfiltration of sensitive page data.

**CVSS v3.1**: 5.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
**CWE**: CWE-79  
**CPE**: cpe:2.3:a:scoreme_project:scoreme:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*  
**EPSS**: 0.01842 (82.689th percentile)

**Impact**: Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.  
**Remediation**: Update to a patched version of the ScoreMe Theme.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues an internal GET / request and matches the string '/wp-content/themes/scoreme/style' to confirm the vulnerable theme is active. It then performs a GET request to `/?s=%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` and verifies the exact unsanitized payload string '</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>' appears in the response body, the Content-Type header contains 'text/html', and the status code is 200.
