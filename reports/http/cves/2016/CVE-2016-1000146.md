## Vulnerability
WordPress Pondol Form to Mail plugin <=1.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `itemid` parameter in `/wp-content/plugins/pondol-formmail/pages/admin-mail-info.php` is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript via a crafted URL. The payload executes in the victim's browser in the context of the affected site, enabling cookie theft, session hijacking, or site defacement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET to `{{BaseURL}}` and internally matches the string `/wp-content/plugins/pondol-formmail/` in the response body to confirm plugin presence. It then sends a GET to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/pondol-formmail/pages/admin-mail-info.php?itemid="></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies success if the unsanitized payload appears verbatim in the body, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
