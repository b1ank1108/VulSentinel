## Vulnerability
The safe-editor plugin before 1.2 for WordPress has no se_save authentication, with resultant XSS (CWE-79). Unauthenticated attackers can inject malicious JavaScript or CSS code into the site, potentially stealing credentials, manipulating site content, or targeting site visitors.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CPE: cpe:2.3:a:kodebyraaet:safe_editor:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*.  
Remediation: Update to the latest version of safe-editor plugin or apply the patch provided by the vendor.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change  
The template performs a raw unauthenticated POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` (action=se_save&type=js&data=alert(document.domain)) that succeeds with HTTP 200 and empty body, then issues a GET to the base URL and confirms the injected payload plus "save_edit_js" marker are embedded in the returned HTML body, verifying unauthorized persistence of the injected JS/CSS on the live site.
