## Vulnerability
WordPress anti-plagiarism plugin <=3.60 (3.6.0 and prior) is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting via unsanitized `m` parameter in `/wp-content/plugins/anti-plagiarism/js.php`. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers, enabling session cookie theft, credential exfiltration, or actions on behalf of authenticated users.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first confirms plugin presence with an internal GET to `/wp-content/plugins/anti-plagiarism/readme.txt` matching words "anti plagiarism" AND "Tags:". It then sends a reflected XSS probe via GET `/wp-content/plugins/anti-plagiarism/js.php?m=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`, verifying the exact payload echoes in the response body, Content-Type contains "text/html", and status is 200. This harmless probe confirms the underlying reflected XSS flaw that leaks sensitive browser data.
