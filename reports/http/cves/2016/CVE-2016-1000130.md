## Vulnerability
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS, CWE-79) in WordPress e-search plugin <=1.0 via unsanitized `date-from` parameter in `tmpl/date_select.php`. Input is reflected verbatim in the HTML output.

CVSS 3.0: 6.1 (Medium)  
Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

Unauthenticated attacker crafts malicious URL; when visited by any user, arbitrary JavaScript executes in the victim's browser context (same-site). Enables cookie theft, credential exfiltration, session hijacking, or further client-side attacks.

Impact: Successful exploitation allows injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential data theft or unauthorized actions.  
Remediation: Update to the latest version of the WordPress e-search plugin.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

Template uses chained HTTP flow (http(1) && http(2)):  
1. GET `/wp-content/plugins/e-search/readme.txt` (internal matcher) confirms plugin by requiring all of "Search", "Tags:", "Tested up to:" in body.  
2. GET `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/e-search/tmpl/date_select.php?date-from=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`  
Matchers (AND): body contains literal "</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>", header contains "text/html", status 200.

This confirms the reflected XSS payload executes without sanitization/encoding.
