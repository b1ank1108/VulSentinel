## Vulnerability
The WordPress Hero Maps Pro plugin version 2.1.0 is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) in `/wp-content/plugins/hero-maps-pro/views/dashboard/index.php` via the unsanitized `v` GET parameter.  

Unauthenticated remote attackers can craft a malicious URL that injects arbitrary JavaScript, which executes in the victim's browser in the context of the vulnerable site.  

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1). Successful exploitation enables cookie theft (session hijacking), defacement, or theft of sensitive client-side data. Remediation: update to 2.1.1 or higher.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues an internal GET to `/wp-content/plugins/hero-maps-pro/readme.txt` and matches the string 'Hero Maps Pro =' to confirm plugin presence. It then sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/hero-maps-pro/views/dashboard/index.php?v="></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies the exact unsanitized payload appears in the response body, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and status is 200.
