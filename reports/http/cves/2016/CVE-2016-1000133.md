## Vulnerability
WordPress forget-about-shortcode-buttons plugin 1.1.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) in `assets/js/fasc-buttons/popup.php`. The `ver` GET parameter reflects unsanitized user input, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of an unsuspecting victim's browser. Impact includes theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, and other client-side attacks. CVSS v3.0: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). Vendor: designsandcode. Framework: WordPress.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template uses a two-step HTTP flow. First, it requests `/wp-content/plugins/forget-about-shortcode-buttons/readme.txt` and internally matches the string 'Forget About Shortcode Buttons =' to fingerprint the plugin. Second, it sends a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/forget-about-shortcode-buttons/assets/js/fasc-buttons/popup.php?source=1&ver=1</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies reflection of the unsanitized payload in the response body, along with `text/html` content-type and HTTP 200 status.
