## Vulnerability
**CVE-ID:** CVE-2016-1000149  
**Name:** WordPress Simpel Reserveren <=3.5.2 - Cross-Site Scripting  
**Severity:** medium  
**CVSS v3.0:** 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
**CWE:** CWE-79  
**Description:** WordPress plugin Simpel Reserveren 3.5.2 and before contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.  
**Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential data theft or unauthorized actions.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to the latest version of the WordPress Simpel Reserveren plugin (>=3.5.3) or apply a patch provided by the vendor to fix the XSS vulnerability.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues an internal GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/simpel-reserveren/readme.txt` and matches for the strings "Simpel Reserveren" and "Tags:" to fingerprint the plugin. It then sends a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/simpel-reserveren/edit.php?page=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies that the unsanitized payload is echoed back verbatim in the response body, the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, and the status is 200, confirming reflection of the XSS payload in the vulnerable `page` parameter.
