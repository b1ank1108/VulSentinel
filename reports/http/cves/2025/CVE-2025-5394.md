## Vulnerability
The Alone – Charity Multipurpose Non-profit WordPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a missing capability check on the `alone_import_pack_install_plugin()` function. This affects all versions up to and including 7.8.3.

Unauthenticated attackers can remotely supply a ZIP URL to install arbitrary plugins (disguised as legitimate packages), enabling webshell deployment and remote code execution on the target WordPress site. Fixed in 7.8.5.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single unauthenticated raw POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=beplus_import_pack_install_plugin` and `data[plugin_source]` set to `https://{{interactsh-url}}/plugin/{{randstr}}.zip`. It verifies the flaw by matching on HTTP 200 status, `application/json` content-type, and a response body containing both `"success":true` and `"substep":"activate"`. No actual plugin is installed or executed—the probe uses a harmless interactsh URL and random string solely to confirm the endpoint processes the request without authentication.
