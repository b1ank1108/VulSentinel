## Vulnerability
CVE-2025-25257 is an unauthenticated SQL injection (CWE-89) in Fortinet FortiWeb. An attacker can execute unauthorized SQL code or commands via crafted HTTP/HTTPS requests to the `/api/fabric/device/status` endpoint by injecting payloads into the `Authorization: Bearer` header. CVSS 3.1 score is 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Exploitation can result in data exposure, data manipulation, or full system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/api/fabric/device/status` using the crafted header `Authorization: Bearer AAAAAA'or'1'='1`. It verifies exploitation success by confirming HTTP 200 status and the presence of the words `serial`, `fortiweb`, and `device_type` in the JSON response body (indicating the injected SQL condition evaluated to true and returned internal device status data).
