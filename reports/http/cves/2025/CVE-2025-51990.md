## Vulnerability
XWiki through version 17.3.0 contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability caused by improper sanitization of inputs in the Administration interface's Presentation section. Authenticated administrators can inject JavaScript payloads (e.g. into the webcopyright field of XWiki.XWikiPreferences) that persist and execute in any visitor's browser context.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template logs in as administrator (GET login page to extract form_token, POST loginsubmit with credentials), navigates to the Presentation admin page (GET to extract second form_token), performs POST /bin/saveandcontinue/XWiki/XWikiPreferences with `<ScRiPt>alert('{{randstr}}');</ScRiPt>` injected into XWiki.XWikiPreferences_0_webcopyright, then GETs the admin page and matches for the exact unsanitized payload in the response body.
