## Vulnerability
IceWarp Mail Server versions 11.4.0 and below contains an open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601). The server fails to validate redirect targets, allowing attackers to supply arbitrary external URLs in crafted paths that trigger a 302 redirect.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).  
Impact: victims following the malicious link are redirected to attacker-controlled sites, enabling phishing and credential theft.  
Remediation: update to a version newer than 11.4.0 and enforce strict allow-list validation for all redirect destinations.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues one unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/%2f%5c%2foast.pro%2f..` and requires both a 302 status and a regex match on the Location header for a URL containing `oast.pro`. This confirms the server reflects the unvalidated external domain without performing version checks or additional fingerprinting.
