## Vulnerability
Navidrome open-source music collection server and streamer (Go-based) contains an authentication bypass in Subsonic API endpoints. Starting in v0.52.0 and prior to v0.54.5, the auth check flaw lets any attacker supply an arbitrary non-existent username plus the salted hash of an empty password; the server treats the request as authenticated. This grants read-only access to endpoints (e.g., user playlists and other data) without valid credentials. Write/modify actions fail with “permission denied”. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.5); CWE-287.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues one raw GET request to `/rest/getPlaylists?u={{randstr}}&t={{md5(randstr)}}&s={{randstr}}&v=1.16.1&c=castafiore&f=json` (non-existent username + MD5 simulating empty-password hash). It matches when the JSON body simultaneously contains `"status":"ok"`, the string `navidrome`, and `subsonic-response`.
