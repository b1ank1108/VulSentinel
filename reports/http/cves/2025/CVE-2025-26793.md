template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2025/CVE-2025-26793.yaml
affected_product: FREEDOM Administration
severity: critical
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: Hirsch (formerly Identiv and Viscount) Enterphone MESH through 2024
preconditions: default credentials not changed
poc_classification: auth-bypass

## Vulnerability
The Web GUI configuration panel of Hirsch (formerly Identiv and Viscount) Enterphone MESH through 2024 ships with hardcoded default credentials (username `freedom`, password `viscount`). Administrators are never prompted to change them during initial setup, and altering the credentials requires multiple complex steps. Attackers can therefore authenticate directly over the Internet to `/mesh/servlet/mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet` and obtain full administrative access to building-management systems, exposing residents’ PII and enabling physical-access control in dozens of Canadian and U.S. apartment buildings. The supplier states that affected systems simply fail to follow the manufacturer’s recommendation to replace the defaults.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a single POST request to `/mesh/servlet/mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet?requestedAction=login` with form body `formLoginName=freedom&formLoginPassword=viscount`, follows redirects, and matches on HTTP 200 status plus the simultaneous presence of the strings “Administration: Controlled Areas” and “Log Out” in the response body to confirm successful login with the factory defaults.
