## Vulnerability
Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in WordPress Custom Login And Signup Widget Plugin (bitto.Kazi) allows authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary PHP code through the plugin settings page. This results in remote code execution on the WordPress server. The issue affects versions from n/a through 1.0.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template logs in to `/wp-login.php` with supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials, POSTs a payload containing `<?php if(isset($_GET['cmd'])) system($_GET['cmd']); ?>` to `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=custom-login-and-signup-widget&editbn1=yes` (which writes the code to the plugin's `content/sn.php` file), and issues a final GET to the injected file. Detection succeeds when the settings response contains the plugin identifier and the shell request returns HTTP 500.
