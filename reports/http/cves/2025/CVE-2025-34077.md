## Vulnerability
WordPress Pie Register plugin versions <= 3.7.1.4 contains an authentication bypass vulnerability. Unauthenticated attackers can impersonate any user (including administrators) by submitting a crafted POST request to the login endpoint with `social_site=true` and a manipulated `user_id_social_site` parameter. This generates a valid WordPress `wordpress_logged_in_` session cookie for the target user ID, enabling full administrative access and potential site takeover via malicious plugin uploads leading to RCE.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template verifies the vulnerability through a two-step process:  
1. Issues a POST request to `/` with form-encoded data (`user_id_social_site=1&social_site=true&piereg_login_after_registration=true&_wp_http_referer=/login/&log=null&pwd=null`) to trigger the bypass for admin (user ID 1), matching on presence of `wordpress_logged_in_` cookie and HTTP 302 status.  
2. Follows up with a POST to `/wp-admin/index.php` (carrying the session cookie and following redirects) to confirm successful admin dashboard access by checking status 200 and presence of strings "Dashboard", "Plugins", "Edit Profile".
