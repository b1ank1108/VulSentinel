## Vulnerability
LaRecipe is an application that allows users to create documentation with Markdown inside a Laravel app. Versions prior to 2.8.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (CWE-1336) via the documentation endpoint, which could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in vulnerable configurations.

Impact: Attackers could execute arbitrary commands on the server, access sensitive environment variables, and/or escalate access depending on server configuration.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 10.0). Vendor: binarytorch, product: larecipe.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a raw GET request to `/docs/1.0/?{{phpinfo()}}` to trigger the SSTI. If vulnerable, the payload executes and the response body contains PHP environment details. It matches HTTP 200 status plus the strings "PHP Extension", "PHP Version", and "larecipe" (condition: and).
