## Vulnerability
The Featured Image from URL (FIFU) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.7 through publicly exposed log files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view potentially sensitive information contained in the exposed log files. Impact includes unauthenticated access to log contents (e.g., dimensions data or error messages) that may leak sensitive details. Remediation: Update to the latest version of the Featured Image from URL (FIFU) plugin.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs unauthenticated GET requests (with redirects enabled, stopping at first match) to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/uploads/fifu-plugin.log` and `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/uploads/fifu-cloud.log`. It confirms exposure by matching HTTP status 200 combined with both `{"fifu-dimensions":` and `"Invalid size:` strings present in the response body, verifying that the plugin's log files are publicly readable and contain expected content.
