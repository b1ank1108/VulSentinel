## Vulnerability
Versa Concerto Spring Boot Actuator endpoints suffer an authentication bypass due to improper X-Real-Ip header handling. Attackers omit the header to reach restricted actuator paths (e.g. /portalapi/actuator), exposing sensitive system information, heap dumps, CSRF tokens and further functionality. Impact includes full unauthenticated actuator access that may chain to additional compromise. Remediation requires upgrading to a version that enforces authentication on all Actuator endpoints irrespective of header presence.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass
The template sends one raw GET request to `/portalapi/actuator` with `Host: {{Hostname}}` and `Connection: X-Real-Ip` (exploiting the header-omission bypass) then matches simultaneously on the word "heapdump" in the response body and "EECP-CSRF-TOKEN" in response headers to confirm successful unauthenticated actuator access.
