## Vulnerability
SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer Metadata Uploader lacks proper authorization on the Metadata Uploader endpoint (`/developmentserver/metadatauploader`), permitting unauthenticated agents to upload arbitrary executable binaries. The flaw (CWE-434) stems from insecure processing of uploaded `.properties` files containing Java serialized objects, enabling unsafe deserialization that leads to remote code execution and full system compromise. Impact includes complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, score 10.0). Remediation requires SAP security note 3594142 and upgrade to the latest patched version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues one raw POST request with multipart/form-data containing a ZIP archive named `.properties`. The archive embeds a base64-decoded Java serialized `Properties` object (padded with a 54-character interactsh DNS URL prefix in the `host`/`authority`/`protocol` fields) to trigger deserialization and out-of-band callback. Detection succeeds on both a DNS interactsh interaction and response body containing the strings `FAILED` and `Cause`.
