## Vulnerability
Loan Management System 1.0 contains an unauthenticated SQL injection in the `username` parameter at `POST /ajax.php?action=login`.  
The flaw permits injection of payloads such as `admin'+or+'1'%3D'1'%23`, allowing attackers to bypass authentication, read arbitrary database contents, modify data, and execute unauthorized administrative operations.  
Unauthenticated remote exploitation is possible with no additional configuration required.  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 10.0) · CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template verifies exploitability with a two-request chain that demonstrates full administrative login bypass:  
1. `POST /ajax.php?action=login` using `username=admin'+or+'1'%3D'1'%23&password=<random-5-chars>` (no valid credentials).  
2. `GET /index.php?page=home`.  
Matchers confirm success if the response body simultaneously contains `window.start_load`, `Welcome back Admin`, and `Loan Management System` while lacking `login-form`. Positive match indicates the SQLi payload successfully authenticated as the admin user.
