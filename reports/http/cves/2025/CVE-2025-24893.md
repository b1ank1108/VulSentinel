## Vulnerability
XWiki Platform contains a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-24893, CWE-95, CVSS 3.1 9.8) in the SolrSearch endpoint. Any guest user can inject Groovy code via the `text` parameter, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server and full compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the XWiki installation. Patched in XWiki 15.10.11, 16.4.1, and 16.5.0RC1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a GET request to `/bin/get/Main/SolrSearch` (or `/xwiki/bin/get/Main/SolrSearch`) with a URL-encoded payload embedding XWiki's `{{groovy}}` and `{{async async=false}}` macros to execute `cat /etc/passwd` and output the result in RSS format. It matches for HTTP 200, `application/rss+xml` Content-Type, and regex presence of both `root:.*:0:0` (from /etc/passwd) and `wiki` in the response body to confirm exploitation.
