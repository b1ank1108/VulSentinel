## Vulnerability
ICTBroadcast is affected by an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-2611, CWE-78) in session cookie handling. The application unsafely passes session cookie data to shell processing, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands that execute on the server. This results in remote code execution without any authentication.

CVSS 3.1 score: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Impact includes potential full server compromise. Versions 7.4 and below are vulnerable; update to later versions.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first issues a GET request to /login.php to extract the session cookie name via regex from the Set-Cookie header. It then sends a second GET request to the same endpoint, setting the extracted cookie name to a payload containing a base64-encoded command (`curl` or `wget` to interactsh-url). The matcher checks for HTTP 200, "ICTBroadcast" in body, and an interactsh DNS callback to confirm execution of the injected command.
