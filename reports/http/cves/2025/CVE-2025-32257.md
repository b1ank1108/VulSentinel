## Vulnerability
1 Click WordPress Migration WordPress plugin (<= 2.2) contains an unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability caused by uncleared debug information in the file `ocm_debug.log`. Attackers can retrieve embedded sensitive data (e.g., SYSLOG entries and plugin archiving details) with no privileges required.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/1-click-migration/ocm_debug.log` and confirms exposure via the combined matcher `status_code == 200` AND `contains_all(body, "debug log content", "SYSLOG", "Archiving plugins")`.
