## Vulnerability
Relative path traversal (CWE-23) in Fortinet FortiWeb allows unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass authentication and execute administrative commands via crafted HTTP/HTTPS requests, leading to potential full system compromise. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Impact includes remote administrative command execution.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single raw unauthenticated POST request exploiting relative path traversal in the URL (`/api/v2.0/cmdb/system/admin%3f/../../../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi`) with a `CGIINFO` header (base64-encoded admin impersonation data) and a JSON body that creates a new local-user administrator account (random username/password, prof_admin profile, trusthost 127.0.0.1/8). Detection matches on HTTP 200 status and response body containing both `"results":` and `"can_clone":`; the created credentials are extracted via DSL.
