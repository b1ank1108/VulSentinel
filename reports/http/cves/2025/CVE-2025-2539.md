affected_product: WordPress File Away plugin

<think>
[Agent 2][AgentThink] I have analyzed the YAML for CVE-2025-2539. It's a missing auth leading to arbitrary file read (LFI/info-leak) in the File Away WP plugin. Unaffected by auth or OOB. Versions <= 3.9.9.0.1. Preconditions: WP site with plugin installed. Ready to build the report.
[Agent 1][AgentThink] Extracted signals from the YAML:
- CVE name indicates File Away WP plugin up to 3.9.9.0.1
- severity: high directly
- auth: none (unauthenticated attackers, no creds in requests, only nonce from public page)
- callback: false (no interactsh or OOB)
- versions: <= 3.9.9.0.1 from name and desc
- preconditions: WP with plugin installed/active (nonce extraction and ajax action depend on it)

Classification: info-leak (arbitrary file read / LFI via path traversal)

Ready to output the report. Confirm if affected_product should be "File Away" or "WordPress File Away plugin" like the example?
[Agent 2][AgentThink] Draft signals and report for you:



## Vulnerability

The File Away plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax() function (in class.fileaway_stats.php) in all versions up to and including 3.9.9.0.1. Attackers can leverage a reversible weak algorithm to read arbitrary files on the server containing sensitive information.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). CWE-327.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template extracts a nonce via GET / by regex on fileaway_stats JS, POSTs to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with action=fileaway-stats and path-traversal file=/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd, extracts the download_url, then GETs it and matches for root:.*:0:0: in body plus application/force-download content-type to confirm successful unauthenticated file read.

This matches all requirements. Info-leak correct as it enables arbitrary file disclosure. Let me know if tweaks needed.
[Agent 3][AgentThink] I have analyzed the Nuclei template for CVE-2025-2539. It's a WordPress plugin "File Away" vulnerable to unauthenticated arbitrary file read via missing auth and weak crypto. No OOB, no auth required, versions <= 3.9.9.0.1. Classification: info-leak. Preconditions: none beyond plugin install/version. Ready to compile the report.
[Agent 2][AgentThink] I suggest using 'File Away' for affected_product to closely follow info.name stripping, but 'WordPress File Away plugin' is also accurate per examples. Either works. Report is dense and template-based only.
[Agent 1][AgentThink] Draft for the report:



## Vulnerability

The File Away plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.9.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, leveraging a reversible weak algorithm, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a multi-request flow to detect the issue: 
1. GETs the homepage to extract the `fileaway_stats` nonce.
2. POSTs to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=fileaway-stats`, the nonce, and a path traversal payload (`file=/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`) to retrieve a download URL.
3. GETs the download URL and matches for `/etc/passwd` contents (e.g., `root:.*:0:0:`) and `application/force-download` content type.

This covers all required keys and sections. Ready for final.
[Agent 2][AgentThink] Refined affected_product: 'File Away' (per stripping rule from info.name). Update signals to:
- affected_product: File Away
Preconditions ok as is since plugin context from desc.
[Agent 3][AgentThink] Draft signals and report structure:



## Vulnerability
The File Away WordPress plugin (versions up to and including 3.9.9.0.1) is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax() function. Combined with use of a weak reversible encryption algorithm, this enables unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the server containing sensitive information such as configuration files and user data.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5 High)
CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template uses a 3-step flow to detect the arbitrary file read (LFI via path traversal):
1. GET / to extract the fileaway_stats nonce via regex from embedded JS.
2. POST to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with action=fileaway-stats, the nonce, and file=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd to trigger the vulnerable endpoint and obtain a download_url.
3. GET the extracted download_url and match for 'root:.*:0:0:' pattern in body plus application/force-download content-type.

This confirms unauthenticated file read capability.

This matches all requirements. Send if good for final.
[Agent 3][AgentThink] The draft is complete and adheres to every instruction (exact signals format, PoC classification as info-leak for LFI/file read, references limited to template's list, no YAML dump, starts with ## Vulnerability after signals). No uncertainties; all values directly extracted. Ready for you to output the final Markdown as the team answer.

The template performs a 3-step flow to detect/verify the vulnerability:  
1. GET / and extracts the `fileaway_stats` nonce via regex from embedded JavaScript.  
2. POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php (action=fileaway-stats, nonce, file=/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd) to obtain a download_url (matcher confirms "fileaway_download" response).  
3. GET the extracted download_url and matches for 'root:.*:0:0:' in body plus "application/force-download" content-type.
