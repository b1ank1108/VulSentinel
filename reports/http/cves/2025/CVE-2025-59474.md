affected_product: Jenkins

## Vulnerability
Jenkins does not perform a permission check in the sidepanel of a page intentionally accessible to users lacking Overall/Read permission. Attackers without Overall/Read permission can therefore list agent names through the sidepanel executors widget (Jenkins 2.527 and earlier, LTS 2.516.2 and earlier).

Impact: Exposure of sensitive infrastructure details (agent names).  
Remediation: Update to a version later than 2.527 or LTS later than 2.516.2.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/securityRealm/signup` (and the `/jenkins/` variant, stopping at first match). It verifies the response body contains executor-status indicators ('Build Executor Status', 'Estado del ejecutor', or `id="executors"`) AND regex matches for agent links (`href="[^"]*/computer/[^"]*/?"`). When matched it extracts agent names via regex capture on `/computer/([^"/]+)` paths (with URL-decoding).
