## Vulnerability
Anhui Xufan Information Technology EasyCVR up to version 2.7.0 contains an information disclosure flaw (CWE-200) in the file `/api/v1/getbaseconfig`. Manipulation of the endpoint leads to exposure of sensitive configuration data. The attack can be initiated remotely without authentication. Public exploit is available; vendor was notified but provided no response. Impact includes unauthenticated retrieval of device passwords and API authentication credentials. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3). Remediation requires upgrade to version 2.7.1 or later.
