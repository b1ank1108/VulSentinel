## Vulnerability
A Host Header Injection vulnerability in Avigilon ACM v7.10.0.20 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via supplying a crafted URL. Attackers can execute arbitrary code remotely by supplying crafted URLs, potentially compromising the system. Remediation: update to the latest version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template uses a two-request flow (`flow: http(1) && http(2)`).  
- Request 1 (internal matcher): `GET /` with original `Host: {{Hostname}}`; verifies product fingerprint by checking response body contains both "Avigilon" and "Access Control Manager".  
- Request 2: `GET /` with injected `Host: {{randstr}}.tld`; matches on HTTP 302 status where `Location` header contains the randomized domain, confirming the Host header is reflected and injectable.
