## Vulnerability
N-central < 2025.4 can generate sessionIDs for unauthenticated users. This issue affects N-central: before 2025.4.

Impact: Attackers can hijack sessions without authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

Remediation: Update to version 2025.4 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends an unauthenticated POST SOAP request to `/dms/services/ServerUI` containing a `sessionHello` envelope with `<applianceID>3</applianceID>`. It matches on HTTP 200 status combined with the presence of both "SessionID" and "sessionHelloResponse" in the body, then extracts the numeric session identifier via regex on `<SessionID>`, `<sessionId>`, or `<sessionID>` tags.
