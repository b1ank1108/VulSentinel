## Vulnerability
Apache Druid management proxy suffers from Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), improper neutralization of input during web page generation (XSS), and open redirect vulnerabilities. Authenticated users can supply specially crafted URLs that cause the proxy to redirect requests to arbitrary external or internal servers. The management proxy is enabled by default in out-of-the-box configurations. Impact includes potential access to internal services, XSS, or XSRF.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first requests `/unified-console.html` and matches for "Apache Druid" string in the body to fingerprint the product. It then issues a raw GET request to `/proxy/coordinator@{{interactsh-url}}` and confirms exploitation if an OOB HTTP or DNS interaction is received on the interactsh server.
