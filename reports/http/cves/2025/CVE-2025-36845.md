## Vulnerability
Eveo URVE Web Manager 27.02.2025 is affected by a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The flaw is caused by improper validation of the `url` GET parameter in the endpoint `/_internal/redirect.php`. Unauthenticated attackers can supply a crafted URL to force the application to issue requests to internal-only endpoints, potentially exposing sensitive internal services or data.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first fingerprints the target application by sending a GET request to `/urve/site/login.html?lang=en` and matching for the string "URVE Web Manager" in the response body together with HTTP status 200 (internal matcher). It then triggers the SSRF by issuing a GET request to `/_internal/redirect.php?url=http://{{interactsh-url}}` and confirms success when an out-of-band DNS interaction is received via the interactsh matcher.
