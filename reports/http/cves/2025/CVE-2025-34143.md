## Vulnerability
An authentication bypass (CWE-287, CVSS 9.8) in ETQ Reliance on the CG (legacy) platform allows unauthenticated attackers with network access to the login page to authenticate as the privileged internal SYSTEM user. The bypass is achieved by appending a trailing space to the username field ("SYSTEM "). The SYSTEM account requires no password. Successful bypass grants elevated access and enables remote code execution by modifying Jython scripts within the application. The issue was resolved in version MP-4583 by stricter validation that excludes internal accounts from public authentication workflows.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template sends a single POST request to `/reliance/resources/sessions` containing the JSON payload `{"username":"SYSTEM ","password":"[random 7-char alphanumeric]"}` and verifies successful privileged login by matching the presence of both "statusCode" and "userId" strings in the JSON response body together with `application/json` content-type.
