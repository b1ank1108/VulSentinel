## Vulnerability
Securden Unified PAM contains an authentication bypass (CVE-2025-53118) that permits unauthenticated remote attackers to access and control administrator backup functions, leading to compromise of all stored passwords, secrets, and active application session tokens.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template executes a chained flow of three unauthenticated HTTP GET requests that must all succeed:  
- `GET /thirdparty-access` (matcher: status_code == 302, internal)  
- `GET /get_csrf_token` (matcher: status_code == 200, body contains 'token', JSON content-type, internal)  
- `GET /get_date_picker_format` (matcher: status_code == 200, body contains 'current_date', JSON content-type)  
This sequence verifies the bypass on endpoints tied to administrator backup control.
