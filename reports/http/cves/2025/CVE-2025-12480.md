## Vulnerability
Gladinet Triofox before 12.91.1126.65588 and CentreStack before 12.10.595.65696 suffer from improper access control (CWE-306). Unauthenticated remote attackers with network access to the `/management/admindatabase.aspx` endpoint can reach full database management functionality, enabling view, configuration changes, data modification, and potential system compromise.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). EPSS 0.73223 (98.764th percentile). Impact covers unauthorized data access and full administrative control of the backend database.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues an unauthenticated GET request to `/management/admindatabase.aspx` and matches HTTP 200 status plus simultaneous presence of the strings `Triofox Enterprise`, `Manage Database`, and `Configure Database` in the response body, confirming the administrative database panel is exposed and accessible without authentication.
