## Vulnerability
Zoo Management System 1.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability via the `username` parameter on the login page at `/admin/index.php`. Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries (e.g. boolean-based bypass) to obtain sensitive database information, modify data, execute unauthorized administrative operations, and bypass authentication entirely, potentially achieving full administrative access.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 10.0). CWE-89. Remediation requires upgrading to a version with proper input sanitization in the login form.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass
The template issues a single raw POST request to `/admin/index.php` using the payload `username=admin%27+or+%271%27%3D%271&password=any&login=` (classic SQLi to force login as admin). It verifies successful exploitation via an AND matcher: HTTP status 200 and response body containing all three strings 'ZMS ADMIN', 'Dashboard', and 'Zoo Management System', confirming access to the protected admin dashboard.
