## Vulnerability
PowerJob 5.1.2 contains a broken access control vulnerability caused by missing authorization on the `/user/list` endpoint. Remote attackers with no special privileges can access unauthorized user resources, leading to data exposure and potential privilege escalation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/user/list` and confirms the bypass by matching HTTP 200 status, `application/json` content-type, and JSON body containing both `"success":true` and `"username":` fields that expose protected user data.
