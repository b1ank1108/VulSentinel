## Vulnerability
FlowiseAI Flowise versions 2.2.6 and below contain an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the `/api/v1/attachments` endpoint. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit path traversal to upload files outside the intended directory, specifically overwriting `~/.flowise/api.json` (or equivalent) with attacker-controlled content. This results in API key injection/exposure and enables remote code execution.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (10.0). CWE-434.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first issues a multipart POST to `/api/v1/attachments/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2froot%2f/.flowise` with a crafted `api.json` payload containing a hardcoded API key/secret. It then authenticates via Bearer token to `/api/v1/apikey`, performs a DELETE on the injected key ID, and confirms success by matching `apiKey`, `apiSecret`, and `chatFlows` strings plus HTTP 200 status in the responses. The first request uses an internal matcher on upload response body fields.
