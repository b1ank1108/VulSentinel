## Vulnerability
Wangshen SecGate 3600 version 2400 contains a path traversal vulnerability caused by unsanitized manipulation of the `file_name` argument to the `?g=log_export_file` endpoint. Remote unauthenticated attackers can traverse the filesystem and read arbitrary files (e.g. `/etc/passwd`), resulting in information disclosure that may lead to further system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request  
`GET /?g=log_export_file&file_name=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`  
and verifies exploitation by confirming HTTP 200, presence of the regex `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body, and `text/plain` content-type.
