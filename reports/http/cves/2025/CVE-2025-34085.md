## Vulnerability
WordPress Simple File List plugin <=4.2.2 contains an unrestricted file upload flaw (CWE-434) in ee-upload-engine.php and ee-file-engine.php. Unauthenticated remote attackers can upload a PHP payload disguised as a .png file, then rename it to .php via the rename action, bypassing extension checks and achieving full remote code execution on the WordPress server (CVSS 9.8: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template executes a three-step chain: (1) POST multipart upload of a PHP one-liner (`<?php echo md5("wordpress-rce-simplefilelist");unlink(__FILE__);?>`) as `{{rand(7)}}.png` to `/wp-content/plugins/simple-file-list/ee-upload-engine.php` using hardcoded eeSFL_ID=1, eeSFL_FileUploadDir, timestamp and token; (2) POST rename via `/wp-content/plugins/simple-file-list/ee-file-engine.php` changing the extension to `.php`; (3) GET the resulting `/wp-content/uploads/simple-file-list/{{rand}}.php` and asserts 200 status plus the expected md5 hash in body_3 to confirm execution.
