## Vulnerability
The Broken Link Notifier plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0 via the ajax_blinks() function which ultimately calls the check_url_status_code() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.

Impact includes the ability to access internal services, read local files, or conduct port scanning from the server's perspective. CVSS 3.1 score is 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N); CWE-918.

Remediation requires updating to version 1.3.1 or later (or temporarily disabling the plugin).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET to the site root and parses the response body for the plugin signature string `blnotifier_front_end` (internal matcher) while extracting a nonce value via regex from inline JavaScript. It then sends a single raw POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` (action=blnotifier_blinks) that supplies the extracted nonce and injects an `http://{{interactsh-url}}` value into the `header_links[]` parameter. Vulnerability is confirmed when an out-of-band DNS interaction is received together with HTTP status 200 and the response body containing the strings `notify`, `timing`, and `Results were generated in`.
