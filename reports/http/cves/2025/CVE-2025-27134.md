## Vulnerability
Joplin Server (free open-source note-taking application server) is vulnerable to privilege escalation (CVE-2025-27134, CWE-284) prior to version 3.3.3. Authenticated non-admin users can send a PATCH request to `/api/users/{id}` (using their own user ID) with `{"is_admin": 1}` to bypass authorization checks and gain full administrator rights, enabling complete server control. CVSS 3.1 score 8.8 (High) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. Fixed in 3.3.3 by restricting `is_admin` field modification.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first sends `POST /api/sessions` with hardcoded credentials (admin@localhost:admin) to obtain `sessionId` cookie and `user_id` from the JSON response. It then issues `PATCH /api/users/{{user_id}}` (with the session cookie and `{"is_admin": 1}` body), followed by `GET /api/users` to confirm via JSON extraction that the user record now shows `is_admin == 1`.
