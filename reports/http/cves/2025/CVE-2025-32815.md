## Vulnerability
An authentication bypass via hardcoded credentials affects Infoblox NetMRI before 7.6.1. The issue (CWE-287) allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass login using the hardcoded Basic Auth credential `_pm:pm19726` (base64: `X3BtOnBtMTk3MjY=`). This grants access to administrative functions and enables reading of sensitive files such as `/etc/shadow`.

CVSS 3.1 score: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N). Impact includes unauthorized admin access and system file disclosure.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects the vulnerability through a two-request chain that exploits the bypass:
1. Issues a GET to `/netmri/common/SetRawCookie.tdf` with crafted `name=letmein&value=%78%79%7a%0d%0a%55%73%65%72%4e%61%6d%65%3d%61%64%6d%69%6e` parameters
