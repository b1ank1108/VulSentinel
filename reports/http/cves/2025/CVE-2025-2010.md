## Vulnerability
The JobWP - Job Board, Job Listing, Career Page and Recruitment Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `jobwp_upload_resume` parameter. All versions up to and including 2.3.9 suffer from insufficient escaping of user-supplied input and lack of prepared statements in the existing SQL query. Unauthenticated attackers can append arbitrary SQL, enabling extraction of sensitive database information (CVSS 7.5, C:H/I:N/A:N, CWE-89). Successful exploitation can lead to data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or further malicious database operations.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-step flow on a target job page. First, a GET to `/jobs/{{jobid}}/` extracts the `jobwp_apply_form_nonce_field` value using a regex matcher on the response body. Second, a multipart/form-data POST to the same endpoint submits the extracted nonce along with a crafted `jobwp_upload_resume` filename payload `xxxxxx\"*sleep(7)*\".pdf` (with other benign form fields). Detection uses a DSL matcher that requires response duration >= 7 seconds, HTTP 200 status, and body containing both `jobwp-` and `apply-` strings, confirming time-based blind SQL injection.
