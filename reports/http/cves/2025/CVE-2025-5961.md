## Vulnerability

The Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `wpvivid_upload_import_files` function. All versions up to and including 0.9.116 are affected. An authenticated administrator can upload arbitrary files (including PHP) to `wp-content/wpvividbackups/ImportandExport/`, leading to remote code execution, complete system compromise, and unauthorized access to sensitive data. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 8.8); CWE-434.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template logs in to `/wp-login.php` with supplied credentials, visits `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpvivid-export-import` to extract the `ajax_nonce` via regex, performs a multipart POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` (action=`wpvivid_upload_import_files`) uploading a PHP webshell payload (system command executor saved as `{{rand_text_alpha(12)}}.php`), then issues a GET to the uploaded file with `?cmd=id` and matches the expected `uid=` regex in the response body to confirm successful RCE.
