## Vulnerability
Infoblox NetMRI before 7.6.1 contains an unauthenticated command injection flaw in the `/webui/application/get_saml_request` endpoint. The `saml_id` parameter is not sanitized, allowing remote unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary operating-system commands with elevated privileges.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 7.2)  
CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single GET request `GET /webui/application/get_saml_request?saml_id=1%26$(id|%20base64);` that injects a shell command to run `id`, base64-encode its output, and force a non-zero exit. It then extracts the error fragment via regex and confirms exploitation with four DSL conditions (AND): presence of shell “command not found” text plus “message”, JSON content-type, status_code==500, and successful base64 decode of the extracted fragment containing both “uid=” and “gid=”.
