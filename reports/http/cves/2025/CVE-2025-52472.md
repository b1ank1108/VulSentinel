## Vulnerability
XWiki is affected by a Hibernate Query Language (HQL) injection vulnerability in its wiki and space search REST API. The flaw, introduced starting in version 4.3-milestone-1, allows injection of malicious HQL queries via the `orderField` parameter. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this to achieve data extraction, authentication bypass, complete database compromise, or remote code execution depending on the database backend and server configuration.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/xwiki/rest/wikis/xwiki/search` appending a malicious payload to the `orderField` parameter. The payload constructs invalid HQL (incorporating `concat`, `chr`, `version()`, and `pg_sleep` to provoke query failure). It verifies exploitation success by checking for a 500 Internal Server Error response with `text/plain` content-type containing both "xwiki" and the specific "QueryException: Exception while executing query. Query statement" error string indicating the injected HQL was processed by Hibernate.
