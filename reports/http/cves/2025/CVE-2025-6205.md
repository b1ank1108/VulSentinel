## Vulnerability

DELMIA Apriso Release 2020 through Release 2025 contains a broken access control vulnerability (CWE-862) caused by missing authorization on the `/Apriso/MessageProcessor/FlexNetMessageProcessor.svc` SOAP endpoint. Unauthenticated attackers can create privileged user accounts with production access; the exploit requires no special conditions. CVSS 3.1 score 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Impact includes full unauthorized privileged access. Remediation requires applying DELMIA security patches for the affected releases.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: state-change

The template issues a single unauthenticated POST request containing a crafted SOAP envelope with an embedded XML payload to the `/Apriso/MessageProcessor/FlexNetMessageProcessor.svc` endpoint. The payload inserts a new employee record (LoginName: LAST, Password: 9, EmployeeRole: Production User). Detection succeeds when the response body contains both `ProcessMessageASync_v2Response` and `<ProcessMessageASync_v2Result>true</ProcessMessageASync_v2Result>`. Extractors return the created credentials. The request performs the actual account creation when the missing authorization flaw is present.
