## Vulnerability
A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the GlobalProtect™ gateway and portal features of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables execution of malicious JavaScript in the context of an authenticated Captive Portal user's browser when they click a specially crafted link. Primary impact is phishing attacks leading to credential theft, with elevated risk if Clientless VPN is enabled.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends one raw GET request to `/ssl-vpn/getconfig.esp` with the `user` parameter set to an SVG-embedded payload `<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><script>prompt("XSS")</script></svg>` together with GlobalProtect client parameters (including a sample `authcookie`). It confirms unsafe reflection if the 200 response body contains both the literal unsanitized `<script>prompt("XSS")</script>` and the string `authentication cookie`.
