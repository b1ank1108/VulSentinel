## Vulnerability
Aquatronica Controller System firmware 5.1.6 and earlier together with its web interface 2.0 and earlier expose an unauthenticated information disclosure flaw via the `/tcp.php` endpoint. Remote attackers can issue a crafted POST request to retrieve the full network configuration XML, including plaintext `WEB_PASSWORD` credentials. Successful extraction grants full administrative access to the controller system.

**Impact**  
Unauthenticated retrieval of sensitive configuration data (including plaintext credentials) with high confidentiality and scope impact (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H, CWE-200).

**Remediation**  
Upgrade firmware to 5.1.7+ and web interface to 2.1+ (proper authentication enforcement on tcp.php).

**Additional metadata**  
- Vendor/product: aquatronica / controller  
- Verified: true  
- Shodan fingerprint: `html:"aquatronica"`

## PoC / Detection
**Classification:** info-leak

The template sends one unauthenticated raw POST request:  
`POST /tcp.php`  
`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`  
Body: `function_id=tcp_xml_request&command=WS_GET_NETWORK_CFG`  

It verifies exposure by confirming HTTP 200 and the simultaneous presence of the strings `WEB_PASSWORD` and `pwd=&quot;` in the response body (direct evidence of plaintext credential leakage).
