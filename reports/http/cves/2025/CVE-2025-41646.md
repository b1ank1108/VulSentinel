## Vulnerability
RevPi Webstatus <= v2.4.5 is vulnerable to an authentication bypass (CWE-704) via incorrect type conversion in the login mechanism. An unauthenticated remote attacker can bypass authentication by sending a crafted login request, leading to full device compromise (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, score 9.8). Remediation requires upgrade to version 2.4.6 or later with proper credential validation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/php/dal.php` with JSON body `{"mode":"LOGIN","username":"admin","hashcode":true}`. It verifies success by matching HTTP 200 status code together with both the strings `"status":"SUCCESS"` and `"sessionId":` in the response body.
