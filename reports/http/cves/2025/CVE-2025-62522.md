affected_versions: from 2.9.18 to before 3.0.0, 3.2.9 to before 4.0.0, 4.5.3 to before 5.0.0, 5.2.6 to before 5.4.21, 6.0.0 to before 6.4.1, 7.0.0 to before 7.0.8, and 7.1.0 to before 7.1.11
preconditions: Vite dev server running on Windows and explicitly exposed to the network
poc_classification: info-leak

## Vulnerability
Vite is a frontend tooling framework for JavaScript. In the listed affected versions, files denied by `server.fs.deny` were sent if the URL ended with `\` when the dev server is running on Windows. This leads to sensitive information disclosure (e.g., `.env` files containing environment variables). Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network are affected. Patched in 5.4.21, 6.4.1, 7.0.8, and 7.1.11.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a raw GET request to `/.env/\` and verifies success with a combined matcher: HTTP status 200, body containing environment-like strings ("VITE_" or "SESSDATA=", "WEIBO_COOKIE="), and no HTML content. This confirms the Windows-specific deny-bypass allowing unauthorized file reads.
