## Vulnerability
HPE OneView contains a remote code execution vulnerability, letting remote attackers execute arbitrary code. The flaw resides in the REST API endpoint `/rest/id-pools/executeCommand`, which accepts and runs unsanitized commands. Impact: remote attackers can execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to full system compromise. Remediation: update to the latest version. Metadata indicates the template is verified with a maximum of 2 requests and matches Shodan fingerprints for HPE OneView instances.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first issues a GET request to `/rest/version` to extract the current API version via JSON extractor. It then performs a PUT request to `/rest/id-pools/executeCommand` with a JSON body containing the command `ping -c 2 {{interactsh-url}}`. Detection succeeds if the response body contains "ExecutableCommand", returns HTTP 200 status, and an out-of-band DNS interaction is received.
