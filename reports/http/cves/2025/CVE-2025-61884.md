## Vulnerability
Vulnerability in the Oracle Configurator product of Oracle E-Business Suite (component: Runtime UI). Supported versions that are affected are 12.2.3-12.2.14. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Configurator.

**Impact**  
Unauthenticated attackers can force the Configurator server to make requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially exposing internal services and sensitive data.

**Remediation**  
Apply the Oracle security patches as described in the Oracle security alert for E-Business Suite.

**CVSS**  
7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  
**CWE**  
CWE-918

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw POST request to `/OA_HTML/configurator/UiServlet` containing a URL-encoded XML `<initialize>` block in the `getUiType` parameter. It sets `return_url` to `http://{{interactsh-url}}` while supplying dummy values for other required fields. Detection succeeds only when the server response body contains both `valid_configuration` and `terminate` strings **and** an out-of-band DNS interaction is received on the interactsh domain.
