## Vulnerability
The User Registration & Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated privilege escalation in versions up to and including 4.1.1. This is due to insufficient restrictions on role type in the `prepare_members_data()` function, allowing unauthenticated attackers to create new user accounts with the 'administrator' role and gain complete control over the affected site.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs full unauthenticated exploitation and verification in a 5-step HTTP flow (using variables for random username, password, and email@oast.fun):

- GET `/membership-registration/` extracts form nonces, IDs, membership field values, and frontend nonces via regex.
- POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` (action=`user_registration_user_form_submit`) submits registration data including username, email, password, and membership selection; matches on success response containing the username.
- POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` (action=`user_registration_membership_register_member`) submits `members_data` JSON with `"role":"administrator"`; matches on "New member has been successfully created."
- GET `/login/` extracts login nonce.
- POST to `/login/` authenticates with the newly created credentials, followed by GET `/wp-admin/users.php?role=administrator` to confirm admin access (matches "Howdy," and the username selector); extracts final username/password on success.
