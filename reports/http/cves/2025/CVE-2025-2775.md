## Vulnerability
SysAid On-Prem versions <= 23.3.40 contain an unauthenticated XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the MDM Checkin endpoint (/mdm/checkin). Unauthenticated attackers can trigger external entity processing to read arbitrary server files, enabling administrator account takeover and potential full system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single POST request to `/mdm/checkin` containing a crafted XML payload with a malicious external DTD entity that references `{{interactsh-url}}/{{filename}}.dtd`. Detection matches the resulting out-of-band HTTP callback (protocol http, User-Agent Java) to confirm the XXE parser resolves external entities.
