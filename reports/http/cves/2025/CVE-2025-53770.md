## Vulnerability
Microsoft SharePoint Server (on-premises) is affected by unsafe deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502) in components handling MSOTlPn_DWP parameters (e.g., via ToolPane.aspx and AclEditor.ascx). This allows remote code execution using LosFormatter gadget chains. It forms part of the ToolShell exploit chain; combined with CVE-2025-53771 it enables fully unauthenticated RCE. Exploited in the wild. CVSS 9.8. Impact: full system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template executes JavaScript to generate two LosFormatter-based deserialization gadgets (using Dataset XML diffgram with ExpandedWrapper for method invocation like Deserialize on LosFormatter, and Xaml payloads). It sends two POST requests to `/_layouts/15/ToolPane.aspx` embedding the gzipped/base64-encoded gadget in the `MSOTlPn_DWP` form field. Success is detected when the server response includes the `X-Nuclei: CVE-2025-53770` header (set by the executed gadget code) alongside the DWP string.
