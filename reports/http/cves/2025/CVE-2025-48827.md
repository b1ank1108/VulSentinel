## Vulnerability
vBulletin versions 5.0.0 through 5.7.5 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.3 are vulnerable to an authentication bypass when running on PHP 8.1 or later. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to access protected API controllers by invoking protected and private methods through changes in PHP 8.1+ Reflection API behavior (ReflectionMethod::invoke() handling).

This leads to remote code execution, enabling arbitrary system command execution as the web server user and potential full system compromise.

CVSS: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), CWE-424.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs detection by issuing an unauthenticated POST request to `/ajax/api/ad/wrapAdTemplate` with randomized `template` and `id_name` parameters. It matches on HTTP 200 status, application/json content-type, and presence of specific strings in the response body (`<div class=`, `ad_{rand_value}_inner`, and the random template string), confirming successful execution of the otherwise protected method.
