## Vulnerability
CWP (Control Web Panel) < 0.9.8.1205 contains a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-48703, CWE-78) caused by unsanitized shell metacharacters in the `t_total` parameter of the filemanager `changePerm` request handler. Unauthenticated attackers with knowledge of a valid non-root username can inject and execute arbitrary OS commands, leading to potential full system compromise (CVSS 3.1 score 9.0: AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first fingerprints the target by issuing a GET request to `/login/index.php` and matching status_code == 200 with body containing both 'Control WebPanel' and 'cwp'. It then sends a POST multipart/form-data request to `/{{username}}/index.php?module=filemanager&acc=changePerm` (targeting `.bashrc` in `/home/{{username}}`) with the `t_total` field set to `curl {{interactsh-url}}`. Exploitation is confirmed by an OOB DNS interaction where the interactsh request contains the expected curl User-Agent.
