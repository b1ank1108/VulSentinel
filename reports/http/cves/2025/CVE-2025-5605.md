severity: medium
authentication: none

## Vulnerability
An authentication bypass vulnerability in the WSO2 Management Console of multiple WSO2 products allows unauthenticated attackers to manipulate request URIs (e.g. appending `;.jar`) to bypass authentication and access restricted endpoints such as memory_info.jsp. This results in disclosure of internal memory statistics (e.g. Collection Usage) but does not lead to full account compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `/carbon/server-admin/memory_info.jsp;.jar` and verifies successful exploitation if the response status is 200 and contains both the strings 'Memory Statistics' and 'Collection Usage'.
