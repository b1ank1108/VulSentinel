## Vulnerability
DELMIA Apriso suffers from an Improper Control of Generation of Code (CWE-94) / file upload vulnerability (CVE-2025-6204) enabling remote code execution. The issue affects Release 2020 through Release 2025. When the upload handler in the webservices does not properly canonicalize filenames or restrict storage paths, an authenticated attacker can use path traversal to upload executable files (e.g. ASP payloads) to web-accessible locations.

CVSS 3.1 Score: 9.0 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Impact: Remote code execution under webserver privileges.

Remediation: Apply DELMIA security patches implementing proper file upload validation and path canonicalization.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template executes a full exploit chain for detection: (1) SOAP POST to /Apriso/MessageProcessor/FlexNetMessageProcessor.svc to process employee XML (using hardcoded credentials), (2) GET /Apriso/Portal/Kiosk/Login.aspx to extract __VIEWSTATE, __EVENTVALIDATION and __VIEWSTATEGENERATOR, (3) POST login with extracted tokens, (4) POST malicious ASP shell (executes "whoami" via WScript.Shell and self-deletes) to /Apriso/webservices/1.1/operation.svc/UploadFile using path traversal (`\..\..\..\portal\Uploads\{{rand}}.asp`), (5) GET the uploaded file to confirm RCE by matching a random string in output.
