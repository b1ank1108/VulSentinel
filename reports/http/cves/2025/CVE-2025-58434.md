## Vulnerability
Flowise <= 3.0.5 is affected by missing authentication (CWE-306) on the forgot-password endpoint. Unauthenticated attackers can request a valid temporary reset token for any email address. The token is then used on the reset-password endpoint to change the target account password, enabling full account takeover of any user (including administrators).

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Impact includes complete compromise of user accounts, data, and administrative access.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template executes the full exploit chain for detection and verification:
1. POST /api/v1/account/forgot-password with target email to obtain and extract the 64-character tempToken (internal matcher: status_code == 201).
2. POST /api/v1/account/reset-password using the extracted token and a random new password (matcher: status_code == 201).
3. POST /api/v1/auth/login with the new credentials to confirm successful authentication (matchers-condition: and; status_code == 200 and body contains user id, email/username, activeWorkspaceId).
