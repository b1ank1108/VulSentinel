## Vulnerability
Mage AI 0.9.75 is affected by insecure default initialization of resource (CWE-1188). The flaw impacts an unknown component and allows remote manipulation. Attack complexity is high and exploitability is difficult. The vulnerability was publicly disclosed; after 7 months of follow-ups the vendor confirmed it will not be addressed and disputes its validity as a security issue. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L (score 5.6).

Impact: Attackers can exploit the insecure default authentication configuration to gain unauthorized access to installations, potentially leading to remote code execution and complete system compromise.

Remediation: Implement proper authentication configuration by following the vendor's security hardening guidelines.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/api/kernels` and matches on HTTP status 200 combined with the presence of both `"kernels": [` and `"metadata": {` in the JSON response body. This confirms the kernel management API is exposed due to missing authentication enforcement from the default configuration.
