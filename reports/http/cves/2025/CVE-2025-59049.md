## Vulnerability
Mockoon before 9.2.0 contains a path traversal and local file inclusion (CWE-22) caused by unsafe templating of server filenames from user input in the static file serving component. Unauthenticated attackers can read arbitrary files on the mock server filesystem via crafted requests.

**CVSS 3.1:** 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  
**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration and credential files.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to version 9.2.0 or later (proper path validation and restriction in template processing).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends one raw GET request `GET /static/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd` (static_dir variable) and verifies success via regex match `root:.*:0:0:` on response body AND word match `application/json` on content-type header.
