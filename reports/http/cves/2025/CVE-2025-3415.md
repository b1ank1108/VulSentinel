## Vulnerability
Grafana versions ≤ 12.0.1 inadvertently expose DingDing (DingTalk) alerting integration URLs containing access tokens to viewers through the alertmanager API endpoint due to a setting oversight when the DingDing integration is enabled. Viewers can retrieve the full webhook URL with the embedded access_token, enabling unauthorized message delivery and notification manipulation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `/api/alertmanager/grafana/config/api/v1/alerts` and verifies exposure by checking if the JSON response body contains both "dingtalk.com" and "dingding-context" strings along with a 200 status and application/json content-type. It then extracts the full DingDing robot send URL including the `access_token` parameter via regex from the response body.
