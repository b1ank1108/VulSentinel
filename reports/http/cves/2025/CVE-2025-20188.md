## Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the Out-of-Band Access Point (AP) Image Download feature of Cisco IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to upload arbitrary files due to a hard-coded JWT token. Exploitation via crafted HTTPS requests to the upload interface enables path traversal and arbitrary command execution with root privileges.

**CVSS:** 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE:** CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first POSTs to `/ap_spec_rec/upload/` using an invalid JWT (matching 401 + "invalid jwt string"). It then generates a JWT with the hard-coded secret "notfound" and uploads a test text file via multipart/form-data with path traversal (`../../usr/binos/openresty/nginx/html/{{rand}}.txt`). Finally, it GETs the file to confirm the string is present, verifying arbitrary file write capability (prerequisite for RCE).
