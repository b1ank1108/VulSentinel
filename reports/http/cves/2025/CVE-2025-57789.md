template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2025/CVE-2025-57789.yaml
affected_product: Commvault
severity: medium
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: before 11.36.60
preconditions: during the brief window between installation and the first administrator login (setup phase before jobs configured)
poc_classification: auth-bypass

## Vulnerability
An issue was discovered in Commvault before 11.36.60. During the brief window between installation and the first administrator login, remote attackers may exploit the default credential to gain admin control. This is limited to the setup phase, before any jobs have been configured. Attackers can exploit default credentials during this window to gain admin control of the Commvault instance.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/commandcenter/publicLink.do` and extracts the `activeMQConnectionURL` value via regex. It then sends a raw POST to `/commandcenter/api/Login` with a JSON body containing the derived default username `{{connection}}_localadmin__`, hardcoded password `YSAtbG9jYWxhZG1pbg==`, and matching commserver string. The request is classified as vulnerable if it returns HTTP 200, `application/json` content-type, and the body contains both `userGUID` and `token`.
