## Vulnerability

Vitest is a testing framework powered by Vite. Its browser mode HTTP server contains a local file read (LFI) vulnerability in the `__screenshot-error` handler, which serves arbitrary files from the filesystem. Remote exploitation is possible when users set `browser.api.host: true` to expose the server on the network. The flaw was introduced by commit 2d62051 and fixed in Vitest versions 2.1.9 and 3.0.4. No workarounds exist.

Impact: Exposure of source code, configuration files, and sensitive credentials (CWE-22, CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N score 5.9).

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template sends the following raw HTTP request to detect the vulnerability:

GET /__screenshot-error?file=/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1

It then verifies exploitation conditions with matchers checking for status_code == 200, content_type containing 'image/png', and regex match 'root:.*:0:0:' in the body.
