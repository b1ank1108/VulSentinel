## Vulnerability
phpMyFAQ <= 4.0.16 contains an information disclosure vulnerability (CWE-202) caused by unauthenticated access to the configuration backup ZIP generation and download endpoint. Remote attackers can trigger backup creation via a single unauthenticated POST request and retrieve the resulting ZIP containing sensitive configuration files (including database credentials), enabling further compromise. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). Impact: exposure of database credentials and other secrets. Remediation: update to 4.0.16 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template verifies the flaw by issuing a POST request to `/api/setup/backup` (Host: {{Hostname}}, Content-Type: text/plain) with body payload `4.1.0-RC`. It then matches on an `application/json` response body containing both `"backupFile":"` and `.zip` strings (negative match on "error" or "forbidden") and extracts the `backupFile` JSON field as `backup_url` to confirm successful unauthenticated backup disclosure.
