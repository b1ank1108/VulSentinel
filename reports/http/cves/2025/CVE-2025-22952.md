## Vulnerability
Elestio Memos <= v0.24.0 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF, CVE-2025-22952, CWE-918) due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs in the markdown link metadata endpoint.

Unauthenticated attackers can exploit SSRF vulnerabilities to access internal services, bypass network security controls, and potentially retrieve sensitive information from internal systems.

CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Remediation: Upgrade to Memos version 0.24.1 or later that properly validates and restricts URL access.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request:

```
GET /api/v1/markdown/link:metadata?link=http://localhost:13042 HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
```

It matches on AND conditions: HTTP status 500, Content-Type containing application/json, and response body containing both 'localhost:13042' and 'connect: connection refused'. This confirms the server performed an internal request to the attacker-chosen URL without sanitization.
