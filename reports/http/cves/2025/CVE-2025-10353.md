## Vulnerability
Melis Technology Melis Platform contains an unrestricted file upload vulnerability due to insufficient validation of the `mcsdetail_img` parameter in the `/melis/MelisCmsSlider/MelisCmsSliderDetails/saveDetailsForm` endpoint. This allows unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious files via a crafted multipart POST request, resulting in remote code execution and potential full system compromise.  
Impact includes arbitrary file upload to the `/media/sliders/0/` path leading to RCE.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-434.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the issue through a two-step process using flow `http(1) && http(2)`:  
1. Issues a multipart/form-data POST (`boundary=----{{rand}}`) to the saveDetailsForm endpoint with `mcsdetail_mcslider_id=0` and a test `.txt` file (`filename="{{rand}}.txt"`) containing unique payload `CVE-2025-10353-{{rand}}`; matches on status 200 and body containing "success" or "uploaded".  
2. Follows with a GET to `/media/sliders/0/{{filename}}` to confirm the exact payload is served back in the response body (DSL matcher on status 200 and content match).
