## Vulnerability
Dify v1.9.1 suffers from broken access control (CWE-287) in the `/console/api/system-features` endpoint. Missing authorization checks allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve sensitive system configuration data, including SSO enforcement settings, leading to information disclosure.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a simple unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/console/api/system-features` and confirms exposure by matching for JSON body containing both `"status":` and `"sso_enforced_for_signin":` keys, `application/json` content-type, and HTTP 200 status.
