## Vulnerability

React Server Components versions 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0 (including react-server-dom-parcel, react-server-dom-turbopack, and react-server-dom-webpack) contain a critical remote code execution vulnerability caused by unsafe deserialization of payloads from HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) and carries a CVSS score of 10.0 (Critical) with metrics CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.

Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code remotely without any authentication requirements, potentially leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability has an EPSS score of 0.5956 (98.206th percentile), indicating a high probability of exploitation in the wild. This vulnerability has been added to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

The flaw allows attackers to craft malicious multipart/form-data payloads that exploit the unsafe deserialization mechanism in React Server Components, enabling arbitrary code execution through prototype pollution and constructor manipulation techniques.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template detects this vulnerability by sending two POST requests to the root endpoint with specially crafted multipart/form-data payloads designed to trigger unsafe deserialization. The detection mechanism works as follows:

1. The template sends POST requests with Next.js-specific headers (`Next-Action`, `X-Nextjs-Request-Id`, `X-Nextjs-Html-Request-Id`)
2. The payload exploits prototype pollution by manipulating the `__proto__` chain and uses constructor injection to execute arbitrary code
3. Two variants are tested:
   - Unix/Linux variant: Uses `process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('echo $((num1*num2))')`
   - Windows variant: Uses `process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('powershell -c "num1*num2"')`
4. The template performs a mathematical calculation (multiplication of two random numbers between 40000-44800) to verify code execution
5. The exploit forces a redirect with the calculation result embedded in the URL parameter
6. Detection is confirmed by checking for the `x-action-redirect` header containing the expected calculation result in the format `/login?a={{result}}`

The template uses a stop-at-first-match strategy and follows redirects to capture the response. A 15-second timeout is set for each request to accommodate potential processing delays.
