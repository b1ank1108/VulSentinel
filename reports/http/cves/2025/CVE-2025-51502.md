## Vulnerability
Microweber CMS 2.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the unsanitized `layout` parameter on the `/admin/page/create` endpoint. Arbitrary JavaScript executes in the browser of authenticated admin users, enabling session hijacking and credential theft.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs authentication by POSTing `username`/`password` to `/api/user_login` (verifying JSON success response). It then issues GET `/admin/page/create?layout="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` and confirms the payload is reflected unescaped in the 200 OK text/html body.
