## Vulnerability
The Plugin Oficial – Getnet para WooCommerce WordPress plugin (slug: wc-checkout-getnet) is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the `page` parameter in `views/partials/settings/privacy-policy.php`. All versions up to and including 1.8.0 are affected. Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser when a crafted link is visited.

**Impact:** Execution of attacker-controlled scripts in the user's browser context, enabling theft of cookies/session data or actions performed on the victim's behalf.

**Remediation:** Update to the latest version beyond 1.7.3.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues one raw GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/wc-checkout-getnet/views/partials/settings/privacy-policy.php?page=1{{payload}}` (where `payload = '"></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script><script>'`). It confirms the vulnerability when `status_code == 200`, the response body contains the unsanitized injected `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` string, and the body also contains the page-specific markers `activepost` and `gnt-modal-controls`. This verifies that the `page` parameter is reflected verbatim into the HTML output without sanitization or escaping.
