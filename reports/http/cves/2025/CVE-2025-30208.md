## Vulnerability
Vite frontend build tool (dev server) contains an arbitrary file read / LFI flaw (CVE-2025-30208, CWE-284). The `@fs` allow-list check can be bypassed by appending `?raw` or `?import&raw` to any path because trailing separators are stripped in some places but not in the query regexes. Successful exploitation returns the raw contents of any existing server file directly in the browser response. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 5.3). Only dev-server instances explicitly bound to the network are reachable; production builds and localhost-only servers are unaffected. Fixed in 6.2.3, 6.1.2, 6.0.12, 5.4.15, 4.5.10.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first fingerprints a Vite instance with a GET to `{{BaseURL}}` and an internal word matcher for “vite” in the body. It then issues GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/etc/passwd?raw` (Linux) and/or `{{BaseURL}}/C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts?raw` (Windows), stopping at the first successful match. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 combined with a regex match for either `root:.*:0:0:` or `Copyright \(c\).*Microsoft Corp` in the response body.
