## Vulnerability
Ditty WordPress plugin versions below 3.1.58 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via its `displayItems` REST API endpoint (`/wp-json/dittyeditor/v1/displayItems`). The endpoint implements no authorization or authentication, permitting unauthenticated visitors to force server-initiated requests to arbitrary URLs. A nonce check added in v3.1.57 is insufficient and can still be bypassed by any authenticated user (including subscribers).

**Impact**: Unauthenticated attackers can interact with internal services, perform network reconnaissance, or exfiltrate sensitive data through the server.

**Remediation**: Upgrade to version 3.1.58 or later to enforce proper authorization checks.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/wp-json/dittyeditor/v1/displayItems` with a JSON payload containing a crafted `layouts` array. Inside the `html` field it injects an `<image default_src="http://{{interactsh-url}}">` tag plus random alphanumeric and integer markers. The vulnerability is verified if the server issues an out-of-band HTTP callback to the interactsh listener, the response body echoes both markers, and the status code is 200.
