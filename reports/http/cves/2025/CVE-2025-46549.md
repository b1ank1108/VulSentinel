## Vulnerability
YesWiki <= 4.5.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability caused by insufficient sanitization of the `template` parameter in the `/BazaR/bazariframe` endpoint. Attackers can craft a malicious URL containing an injected `<script>` payload; when a victim clicks the link, the payload executes in the victim's browser context. Impact includes stealing cookies, hijacking sessions, defacing the website, or embedding malicious content. Remediation requires updating to version 4.5.4 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template issues one raw GET request to `/?BazaR/bazariframe&id=2&template=%3cscript%3ealert(document.domain)%3c%2fscript%3e` and verifies reflection by checking that the response body simultaneously contains the unsanitized `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` payload, the string "YesWiki", HTTP status 200, and a Content-Type header with "text/html".
