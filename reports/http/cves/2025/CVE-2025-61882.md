## Vulnerability
Oracle E-Business Suite 12.2.3–12.2.14 (specifically Oracle Concurrent Processing) contains a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability exploitable over HTTP. Unauthenticated remote attackers with network access can achieve full system compromise and complete takeover.

**Impact**  
Unauthenticated attackers can fully compromise Oracle Concurrent Processing, leading to complete system takeover.

**Remediation**  
Update to the latest available version beyond 12.2.14.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs a two-step detection chain. First, it issues a POST to `/OA_HTML/SyncServlet` with a crafted SyncML payload containing a base64-encoded basic credential (`sysadmin:INVALID`) to trigger internal processing and extract a session identifier (`sid`) when the response contains `RespURI`, `Final`, and `sid` tokens (status 200). Second, it issues a GET to `/OA_HTML/help/../ieshostedsurvey.jsp` performing path traversal; successful LFI is confirmed by status 200 and the presence of the literal string `$Header: ieshostedsurvey.jsp` in the body. This probe verifies the underlying flaw that enables the full pre-auth RCE chain (LFI/SSRF components) without requiring valid authentication or external interaction.
