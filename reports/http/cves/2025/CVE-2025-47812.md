## Vulnerability
Wing FTP Server <= 7.4.3 suffers from an unauthenticated remote code execution (CVE-2025-47812, CVSS 9.8) caused by improper NULL byte (%00) handling in the `username` parameter on the login endpoint. When anonymous login is enabled, an attacker can inject arbitrary Lua code into session files via a crafted `username=anonymous%00]]...` payload. The injected code executes with elevated privileges as soon as any authenticated endpoint (e.g. `/dir.html`) is subsequently accessed, allowing full command execution. Fixed in 7.4.4 by proper NULL-byte sanitization during authentication.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template verifies the flaw by issuing a POST to `/loginok.html` with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` containing `username=anonymous%00]]%0dlocal h = io.popen("echo CVE-2025-47812")%0dlocal r = h:read("*a")%0dh:close()%0dprint(r)%0d--&password=`. It then issues a GET to `/dir.html` and matches `status_code == 200` AND `contains(to_lower(body), "cve-2025-47812")`.
