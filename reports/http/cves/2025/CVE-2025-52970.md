## Vulnerability
Fortinet FortiWeb is affected by improper parameter handling in versions 7.6.3 and below, 7.4.7 and below, 7.2.10 and below, and 7.0.10 and below. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker possessing non-public information pertaining to the device and targeted user to bypass authentication and gain administrative privileges through a specially crafted request.

**CVSS:** 8.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE:** CWE-223  
**Impact:** Unauthenticated remote attackers can gain administrative privileges, leading to full control over the device.  
**Remediation:** Update to a version later than 7.6.3, 7.4.7, 7.2.10, or 7.0.10 or the latest available version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first probes `/login` (redirects enabled) to confirm the presence of `name="secretkey"` (internal matcher). It then executes a 26-request chain of GET requests to `/api/fabric/device/status` using malicious `Authorization: Bearer` headers containing SQL-injection payloads (`;drop table...`, `;create table...`, `;insert...`, multiple `;update...set a=(select concat...` to build Python code, and `;select...into outfile...`). These manipulate a temporary `fabric_user.{{random}}` table, write malicious code to `/var/log/lib/python3.10/pylab.py` and a custom CGI file under `/migadmin/cgi-bin/`, then trigger execution via `/cgi-bin/ml-draw.py` and `/cgi-bin/{{random}}.cgi` (User-Agent: id). Success is verified by `status_code == 200` and `regex('uid=([0-9(a-z)]+) gid=([0-9(a-z)]+)', body)`.
