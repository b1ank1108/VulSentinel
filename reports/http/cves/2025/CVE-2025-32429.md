## Vulnerability
XWiki Platform is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `getdeleteddocuments.vm` template. The `sort` parameter is concatenated unsanitized directly into an HQL query as the ORDER BY clause. Affected versions are 9.4-rc-1 through 16.10.5 and 17.0.0-rc-1 through 17.2.2. 

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Any attacker (no authentication required) who can reach the liveData endpoint can inject arbitrary SQL, enabling data leakage, database modification, or further compromise of the application.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/xwiki/rest/liveData/sources/liveTable/entries?sourceParams.template=getdeleteddocuments.vm&sort=injected`. Vulnerability is confirmed by an HTTP 500 response whose body contains all of "Exception", "org.xwiki.livedata.LiveDataException", and "HqlQueryScriptService" while the Content-Type header includes "text/javascript". This probe triggers the unsanitized HQL ORDER BY insertion and verifies the injection point without performing actual data modification.
