## Vulnerability

Landray EIS 2001 through 2006 contains a SQL injection vulnerability caused by unsanitized input in `Message/fi_message_receiver.aspx?replyid=`. Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands via crafted input, leading to data theft, modification, or deletion.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template sends a single raw GET request to `/Message/fi_message_receiver.aspx?replyid=1%20and%201=CONVERT(VARCHAR(32),HASHBYTES('MD5','123'),2)--+` and confirms exploitation success if status_code == 500 and body contains "202CB962AC59075B964B07152D234B70", "varchar", and "Landray".
