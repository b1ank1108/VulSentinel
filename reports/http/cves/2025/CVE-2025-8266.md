## Vulnerability
ChanCMS <= 3.1.2 contains an insecure deserialization vulnerability caused by manipulation of the `targetUrl` argument in the `getArticle` function of `app/modules/cms/controller/collect.js`. Remote attackers can supply crafted input to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to full system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template sends one raw GET request to `/cms/gather/getArticle?targetUrl=http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1&parseData=return+process.mainModule.require(%27child_process%27).execSync(%27id%27).toString()`. Detection succeeds when the response meets all three conditions: HTTP 200, body contains Linux `id` output strings ("uid=", "gid=", "groups="), and headers contain "ChanCMS".
