## Vulnerability
The Order Delivery Date Pro for WooCommerce WordPress plugin before 12.3.1 lacks authorization and CSRF checks in its `orddd_import` AJAX handler and fails to restrict imported options to plugin-specific keys only. Unauthenticated remote attackers can therefore perform arbitrary WordPress option updates, e.g., setting `users_can_register` to `1` and `default_role` to `administrator`. This enables new-user registration as site administrators and results in complete site takeover.  
CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). CWE-862 Missing Authorization.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template performs a reversible three-request flow that both exploits and verifies the arbitrary-option-update primitive:  
1. POST multipart form to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=orddd_import` containing a crafted serialized payload `{users_can_register:1, default_role:administrator}`; matches on JSON success response.  
2. GET `/wp-login.php` to confirm registration form is now visible (`wp-login-register` string present).  
3. Second POST reverts options (`users_can_register:0`) followed by GET that confirms the registration form is no longer present (negative matcher).  
The entire sequence runs without credentials and leaves the target unchanged.
