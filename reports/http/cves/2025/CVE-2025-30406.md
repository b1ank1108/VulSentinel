## Vulnerability
Gladinet CentreStack portal (through 16.1.10296.56315) contains an unauthenticated .NET deserialization flaw (CWE-502) caused by a hard-coded machineKey used for ViewState processing. Attackers who know the machineKey can serialize arbitrary payloads and submit them, triggering server-side deserialization that leads to remote code execution and full server compromise. The issue was exploited in the wild in March 2025. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Remediation requires upgrading to 16.4.10315.56368 or later, which uses randomly generated machineKeys.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single POST to `/portal/loginpage.aspx` with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` containing a massive `__VIEWSTATE` value: a base64-encoded, gzipped XAML ResourceDictionary payload that chains ObjectDataProvider → GZipStream → Assembly.Load → Type.GetTypes → InvokeMember to instantiate and execute a delegate. The request is matched on `status_code == 302` and a DSL condition confirming the CVE string in the response.
