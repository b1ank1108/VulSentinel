## Vulnerability
CVE-2025-2747 is an authentication bypass (CWE-287) in Kentico Xperience 13 CMS Staging Sync Server (`SyncServer.asmx` endpoint). It arises from flawed password handling when the server is defined with None type. Unauthenticated attackers can bypass WS-Security authentication to control administrative objects. Impact includes potential full CMS compromise. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). Fixed in 13.0.179+.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues a single POST request to `/CMSPages/Staging/SyncServer.asmx` with a SOAP envelope including a hardcoded WSSE UsernameToken (username: `y3t4kallxq`, specific password digest and nonce) and a random alphanumeric string inside the `stagingTaskData` CDATA. Detection succeeds when the response body reflects the random string plus `<wsa:Action>`, has `text/xml` content-type, and avoids negative error messages (e.g., service not enabled, license errors, auth failures).
