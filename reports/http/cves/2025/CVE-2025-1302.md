## Vulnerability
JSONPath Plus versions prior to 10.3.0 contain a critical remote code execution flaw (CVE-2025-1302, CWE-94) due to improper sanitization of user-supplied path expressions. The library's default `eval='safe'` mode is unsafe; an attacker-supplied expression can escape the sandbox and trigger `Function` constructor execution, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code to run in the Node.js context. This is an incomplete remediation of CVE-2024-21534. CVSS 3.1 score is 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Successful exploitation yields full system compromise on the host running the vulnerable library.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues a single unauthenticated POST request (Content-Type: application/json) to one of the following paths—`/query`, `/jsonpath`, `/api/query`, `/data`, `/parse`, or `/filter`—with a JSON body containing a malicious `$..[?(p=...)]` expression. The payload constructs a `Function` object that calls `child_process.execSync('curl {{interactsh-url}}')`. Detection succeeds when the response body contains the literal string `"result":` **and** an out-of-band DNS interaction is observed on the interactsh server, confirming that the injected command executed on the target.
