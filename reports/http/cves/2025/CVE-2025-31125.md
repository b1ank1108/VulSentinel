## Vulnerability
Vite Development Server @fs endpoint suffers from path traversal (CWE-200) allowing arbitrary file reads outside the project root (e.g. /etc/passwd, C:/windows/win.ini) via crafted URLs when the dev server is bound to a network interface.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 5.3, medium).  
Impact: sensitive system file disclosure.  
Remediation: upgrade or avoid network exposure (--host flag / server.host); apply access restrictions if upgrade delayed.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues four raw GET requests to `/@fs/` with direct paths (C:/windows/win.ini), Unix paths (/etc/passwd), traversal sequences, and double-encoded variants, all appending `?import&?inline=1.wasm?init`. It stops at the first match and confirms success when the body contains all of "data:application/octet-stream", "base64", "import init" and the response header contains "text/javascript".
