## Vulnerability
Monsta FTP <= 2.11.2 contains an unrestricted file upload vulnerability caused by lack of authentication on file uploads, letting unauthenticated attackers execute arbitrary code by uploading crafted files.

**Impact**: Unauthenticated attackers can upload malicious files to execute arbitrary code, potentially compromising the server.

**Remediation**: Update to the latest version beyond 2.11.

**CVSS**: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE**: CWE-434

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/mftp/` (or root path) with `stop-at-first-match`, `host-redirects`, and `max-redirects: 2` to fingerprint the application (status_code == 200 && contains(body, "MonstaFTP")) and internally extracts version via regex `monsta-min-([0-9.]+)\.js`.  

It then sends a raw POST to `/mftp/application/api/api.php` (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded) with JSON payload setting `connectionType: "ftp"`, `host: "{{interactsh-url}}"`, `actionName: "downloadFile"`. Detection triggers on `interactsh_protocol == "dns"` AND `compare_versions(version, "<= 2.11.2")`.
