## Vulnerability
Sante PACS Server.exe contains a path traversal information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2025-2264, CWE-22). An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit it to download arbitrary files from the disk drive where the application is installed. Impact includes exposure of sensitive patient data, credentials, and configuration files (e.g., the internal SQLite database containing USER tables). CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). Remediation: upgrade to version 4.1.1 or later that properly validates file paths.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the vulnerability by sending one raw unauthenticated GET request `GET /assets/../../.HTTP/HTTP.db` that traverses outside the web root to retrieve the application's internal SQLite database file. Success is confirmed when status_code equals 200 and the response body contains all of 'SQLite', 'TABLE USER', 'format'.
