## Vulnerability
The Simple User Registration WordPress plugin ≤ 6.3 is vulnerable to unauthenticated privilege escalation (CWE-269). It fails to restrict user meta values (specifically the `role` field) during registration via the `wpr_submit_form` AJAX action. Unauthenticated attackers can register a new account with `administrator` privileges, achieving full site takeover.

CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Impact: Attacker gains complete control over the WordPress installation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template actively exploits the flaw in two HTTP requests:  
1. `GET /register/` extracts `wpr_nonce` and `wpr_form_id` via regex from the registration page body.  
2. `POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` submits a crafted registration payload (random username/email/password + `wpr[wp_field][role]=administrator`) using the extracted values.  

Matchers confirm exploitation success with `contains(body_1, "WPR Register") && contains(body_2, "user_id") && contains(body_2, "Registration Done")`. The probe is intrusive and will create a new administrator account on vulnerable targets.
