## Vulnerability
Teleport is vulnerable to CVE-2025-49825, a remote authentication bypass that allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to affected systems.

Description: Teleport versions prior to 17.5.2 are vulnerable to a remote authentication bypass vulnerability. This issue allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to affected systems.

Impact: Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to Teleport systems, potentially compromising protected infrastructure and sensitive resources.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8)  
EPSS: 0.11526 (93.48th percentile)

Remediation: Upgrade to 17.5.2, 16.5.12, 15.5.3, 14.4.1, 13.4.27 or 12.4.35 depending on branch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/webapi/ping`, extracts `server_version` from the JSON response (internal extractor), applies OR-ed `compare_versions` DSL matchers across all vulnerable branches, and confirms Teleport presence via body content matchers containing both "server_version" and "teleport". This is a passive, non-intrusive version fingerprint used to detect exposure to the authentication bypass.
