## Vulnerability
Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (CWE-22) vulnerability in wp01ru WP01 plugin for WordPress allows path traversal. This issue affects WP01 from n/a through 2.6.2. Unauthenticated remote attackers can traverse paths in the `wp01_generate_zip_archive` AJAX action to generate and download ZIP archives containing arbitrary server files (e.g., /etc/passwd, wp-config.php, credentials). CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). Fixed by upgrading to 2.6.3+ with proper file-path validation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template actively exploits the path traversal for detection:  
- POSTs to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=wp01_generate_zip_archive` with `target=passwd&path=/etc/` and matches JSON 200 response containing "wp-01-passwd.zip".  
- Follows with GET to `/wp-content/wp01-backup/wp-01-passwd.zip` and confirms 200 response with `application/zip` content-type.
