severity: low
authentication: none
external_callback: false
affected_versions: prior to 7.1.5, 7.0.7, 6.3.6, and 5.4.20

## Vulnerability
Vite (frontend tooling framework for JavaScript) dev server contains a path-traversal flaw (CWE-22) that serves files whose names match entries in the public directory while bypassing `server.fs` restrictions. CVSS 3.1: 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). Only configurations exposing the dev server to the network (`--host` or `server.host`), using the default-enabled public directory, and containing a symlink inside it are impacted. Successful exploitation yields unauthorized filesystem reads and potential sensitive-data disclosure. Fixed in 7.1.5, 7.0.7, 6.3.6, 5.4.20.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/../package.json` and confirms exploitation when the response satisfies all three conditions: HTTP 200, Content-Type containing `application/json`, and response body containing both the literal strings `"name":` and `"overrides":` (standard top-level keys present in a root-level `package.json`).
