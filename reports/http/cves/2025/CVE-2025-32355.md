## Vulnerability
Rocket TRUfusion Enterprise through 7.10.4.0 uses a reverse proxy to handle incoming connections. The proxy is misconfigured such that absolute URLs in the HTTP request line cause it to load arbitrary resources. Impact includes information disclosure or further attacks.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends one unsafe raw GET request with absolute URL `http://127.0.0.1:8080/axis2/services/listServices` in the request line (routed via the target's reverse proxy). It matches on HTTP 200 status and presence of either "Available services" or "Service Description" in the body to confirm the SSRF permits loading of unauthorized internal Axis2 service listings.
