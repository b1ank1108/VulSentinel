## Vulnerability
Zimbra Collaboration Suite is affected by CVE-2025-27915 (CWE-79, CVSS 5.4), a stored XSS vulnerability in the Classic Web Client. Insufficient HTML sanitization of ICS calendar files allows JavaScript execution via an `ontoggle` event inside a `<details>` tag. Exploitation occurs when an authenticated user views an email containing a malicious ICS entry, resulting in session hijacking and data exfiltration in the victim's browser context. The issue is KEV-listed.

**Impact**  
Authenticated users viewing malicious ICS files can have JavaScript executed in their browser context through stored XSS, potentially leading to session hijacking and data exfiltration.

**Remediation**  
Upgrade to Zimbra Collaboration Suite version 9.0.1, 10.0.13, or 10.1.5 or later that properly sanitizes HTML content in ICS files.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs version detection rather than active exploitation. It issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/js/zimbraMail/share/model/ZmSettings.js`, verifies the response body contains "Zimbra Collaboration Suite" and the Content-Type header is `application/x-javascript`, extracts the `CLIENT_VERSION` via regex matching `CLIENT_VERSION\",\s+{type:ZmSetting\.T_CONFIG, defaultValue:"([0-9.]+)_([A-Z_0-9]+)"\}`, and applies DSL matchers with `compare_versions` (condition: or) to identify vulnerable ranges.
