## Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the PAN-OS management interface allows authentication bypass through path confusion between Nginx and Apache handlers. The issue occurs due to differences in path processing between Nginx and Apache, where double URL encoding combined with directory traversal can bypass authentication checks enforced by the X-pan-AuthCheck header.

Unauthenticated attackers can completely bypass authentication to gain unauthorized access to the PAN-OS management interface, potentially compromising the entire firewall infrastructure.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 10.0). CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/unauth/%252e%252e/php/ztp_gate.php/PAN_help/x.css` and matches on status_code 200, text/html content-type, and the presence of "Zero Touch Provisioning" or "Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP)" in the page title. This detects successful path confusion bypass by confirming access to an otherwise protected ZTP page.
