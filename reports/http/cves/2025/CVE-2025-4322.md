## Vulnerability
Motors WordPress theme is vulnerable to unauthenticated privilege escalation via password update/account takeover (CVE-2025-4322) in all versions up to and including 5.6.67. The flaw stems from missing user-identity validation before password changes. Unauthenticated attackers can therefore set arbitrary user passwords (targeting `user_id=1` for administrators) and immediately take over accounts for complete site compromise.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8)  
CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change)  

Impact: full administrative access and site takeover.  
Remediation: upgrade to 5.6.68 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends an unauthenticated raw POST to one of 13 common account paths (e.g. `/login`, `/my-account`, `/signin`, `/forgot-password`, `/user/login`) using query string `?user_id=1&hash_check=%25C0` and form field `stm_new_password=<12-char-random>`. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 combined with response body containing both `"Enter new password"` and `"stm-validation-message"`, confirming the endpoint accepted the password change without authorization.
