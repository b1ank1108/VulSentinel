## Vulnerability
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the XWiki DeleteApplication endpoint (AppWithinMinutes) via unsanitized `xredirect` parameter. The payload is reflected into the deletion confirmation message HTML; the supplied script executes in the victim's browser when they click the "No" button. Affects both XWiki Platform Flamingo Skin Resources and XWiki Platform Web Templates. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1, CWE-80). Impact includes session hijacking, data theft, or further client-side attacks. Fixed in 16.10.10 and 17.4.2 (remediation also references earlier branch patches: 14.10.14, 15.5.1, 15.8-rc-1+).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

Template issues GET requests to two candidate paths (`/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/DeleteApplication` and `/xwiki/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/DeleteApplication`) using fixed `appName=Help.Applications.Contributors&resolve=true` and a malicious `xredirect` embedding the payload `';alert(document.domain)//`. Stops at first match. Detects successful reflection by requiring both (1) specific unsanitized strings in body (`;;alert(document.domain)//"><input class="button secondary` AND `onclick="location=`) and (2) `text/html` Content-Type with HTTP 200 status.
