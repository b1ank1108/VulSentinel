## Vulnerability
The LearnPress – WordPress LMS Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to broken access control (CWE-862) due to a missing capability check on the statistic function in all versions up to and including 4.3.1. Unauthenticated attackers can retrieve the plugin's orders statistics, including total revenue summaries and order status counts (completed/pending/cancelled).  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (5.3).  
Impact: information disclosure of sensitive order data.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json/lp/v1/orders/statistic` and verifies exploitation by checking for HTTP 200, `application/json` Content-Type header, `"status":"success"` in the body, and presence of statistics fields such as `"total-raised"`, `"order-completed"`, `"order-pending"`, `"order-cancelled"`, and `"Total Raised"`.
