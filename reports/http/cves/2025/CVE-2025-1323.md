## Vulnerability
The WP-Recall – Registration, Profile, Commerce & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'databeat' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 16.26.10 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries through the databeat parameter, leading to extraction of sensitive database information including user credentials and personal data.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5) • CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a GET request to the site root (`{{BaseURL}}/`) and extracts the Rcl nonce value via regex from the page body. It then issues a raw POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=rcl_beat`, the extracted `ajax_nonce`, and a `databeat` JSON payload containing a UNION SELECT injection inside the `last_activity` field of the `rcl_chat_get_new_messages` beat (concatenating a random marker with `version()`). Detection succeeds when the response body contains the marker string together with the expected JSON structure and content indicators, confirming successful SQL injection and in-band data reflection.
