## Vulnerability
Stop User Enumeration WordPress plugin < 1.7.3 contains an authentication bypass caused by improper handling of the REST API path `/wp-json/wp/v2/users/`. Attackers can bypass the plugin's user enumeration restrictions with a crafted request, enabling unauthenticated extraction of user account details and facilitating subsequent brute-force attacks. CVSS 3.1: 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). Remediation requires upgrading to 1.7.3 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template executes a two-step HTTP flow to confirm the vulnerability:

1. GET `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json/wp/v2/users` (internal matcher) verifies the plugin is active and enforcing protection by matching status_code==401 && body contains "Only authenticated users can access the User endpoint REST API".
2. GET `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json/wp/v2/users?foo=simple-jwt-login` checks for successful bypass: status==200, content-type contains "application/json", and body matches regex `{"id":\d,"name":".*","url"`.

This confirms the bypass grants access to the full user list that should be blocked.
