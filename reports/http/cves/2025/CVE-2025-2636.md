## Vulnerability
The InstaWP Connect - 1-click WP Staging & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local PHP File Inclusion via the 'instawp-database-manager' parameter in all versions up to and including 0.1.0.85 (CWE-22). Unauthenticated attackers can include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server, allowing execution of any PHP code in those files and potential complete server compromise.

CVSS 3.1 score: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a crafted GET request exploiting the LFI by traversing to include `/migrate/templates/debug/db-table` with `table_name=wp_users` to dump user data. Success is confirmed by matching 'instawp-wrap', 'user_pass</th>', and 'user_email</th>' in the 200 OK response body.
