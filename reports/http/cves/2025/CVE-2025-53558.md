## Vulnerability
ZXHN-F660T and ZXHN-F660A devices provided by ZTE Japan K.K. ship with a hardcoded common credential (`admin`/`admin`) for all installations. Knowledge of this credential allows any remote attacker to log in to the web management interface, potentially gaining full control over network equipment and configurations.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a single unauthenticated POST to `/` submitting the form `frashnum=&action=login&Frm_Logintoken=0&Username=admin&Password=admin`. Success is confirmed by a 302 redirect whose Location header contains `/start.ghtml` combined with absence of error strings ("wrong username" or "User information is error") in the response body.
