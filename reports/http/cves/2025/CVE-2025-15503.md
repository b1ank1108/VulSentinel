## Vulnerability
Sangfor OSM (Sangfor Operation and Maintenance Management System) <= 3.0.8 is vulnerable to unrestricted file upload in /fort/trust/version/common/common.jsp by manipulating the "File" argument. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to upload arbitrary files, leading to remote code execution and system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template executes a two-step detection: (1) POSTs a multipart/form-data payload uploading a random-named JSP file containing MD5 computation code for a random number (self-deleting after execution); matches on status 200 and "Upload success". (2) GETs the uploaded JSP and verifies RCE by checking response body contains the computed MD5 hash.
