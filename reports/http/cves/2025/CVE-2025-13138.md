## Vulnerability
The WP Directory Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'columns_search' parameter of the select_2_ajax() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

An unauthenticated attacker can extract sensitive information from the WordPress database including user credentials, posts, and other data. Fixed in 1.4.4 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=wdk_public_action&page=wdk_frontendajax&function=select_2_ajax&table=category_m` and a time-based blind SQLi payload in `columns_search=category_title)%20AND%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(7)))a)--%20-` (plus benign `q[term]=test`). It verifies exploitation conditions via DSL matchers requiring response duration >=7s, HTTP 200 status, and "success" substring in body.
