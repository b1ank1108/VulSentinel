## Vulnerability
IdeaCMS versions up to and including 1.7 are vulnerable to SQL injection in the `field` parameter of the article list (`/api/v1.index.article/getList.html`) and goods list (`/api/v1.index.goods/getList.html`) API endpoints. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary SQL queries and extract sensitive data from the backend database, including user information and credentials (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, score 9.8, CWE-89).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends two raw GET requests injecting `id,md5({{num}})` (where num=999999999) into the `field` query parameter of the respective endpoints (with additional filters `cat=3` for articles and `activity_type=hot` for goods). Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 responses that simultaneously contain the computed MD5 hash value, the substring `id":1`, and `data":` (stop-at-first-match across the two endpoints).
