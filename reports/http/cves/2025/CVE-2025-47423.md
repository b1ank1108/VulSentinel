## Vulnerability
Personal Weather Station Dashboard 12_lts contains a directory traversal (CWE-24) flaw allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files via `../` sequences in the `test` parameter of `/others/_test.php`. Demonstration reads the server's private SSL key in cleartext. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.8). Impact includes exposure of sensitive cryptographic material and any other filesystem contents reachable by the web server process. Remediation requires upgrade to any version later than 12_lts that enforces proper file-path validation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template executes a two-step HTTP flow that fingerprints the product then triggers and confirms the LFI:

- Request 1 (internal matcher): `GET /` checks response body contains `PWS Dashboard</title>` to confirm target identity.
- Request 2: `GET /others/_test.php?test=../../../apache/conf/ssl.key/server.key` verifies HTTP 200 and simultaneous presence of both `BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY` and `END RSA PRIVATE KEY` strings in the body, proving successful traversal to the private SSL key file.
