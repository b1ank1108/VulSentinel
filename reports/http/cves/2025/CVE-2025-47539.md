## Vulnerability
The Eventin WordPress plugin before 4.0.27 contains an unauthenticated privilege escalation vulnerability (CWE-269, CVSS 3.1: 9.8 AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). A missing permission check on the REST API endpoint `/wp-json/eventin/v2/speakers/import` allows remote unauthenticated attackers to import speaker records with arbitrary roles, including administrator, leading to full site compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated raw POST request to `/wp-json/eventin/v2/speakers/import?_locale=user` as multipart/form-data. The payload contains a JSON array in `speaker_import` with a crafted speaker record (random name, `@oast.fun` email, role set to "administrator"). It matches on HTTP 200 status, `application/json` content-type, and the string "Successfully imported speaker" in the body to confirm the endpoint accepts the privileged user creation without authentication.
