## Vulnerability
MeteoBridge <= 6.1 web interface (CGI shell scripts and C) exposes the `/public/template.cgi` endpoint to command injection via the `templatefile` parameter. Remote unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on affected devices.

**Impact:** Complete device compromise through root-level OS command execution.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to version 6.2 or later (proper input sanitization in `template.cgi`).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a GET request to `/public/template.cgi?templatefile=$(id)` and confirms exploitation on HTTP 200 responses containing both the string 'Error: template file' and command-output markers 'uid=' and 'gid=' (verifying successful `id` execution).
