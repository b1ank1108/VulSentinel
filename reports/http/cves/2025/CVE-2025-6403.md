## Vulnerability

Code-Projects School Fees Payment System 1.0 contains a critical SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-74) affecting unknown processing of the file `/student.php`. Manipulation of the `ID` argument (under `action=delete`) allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands. The exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used. Impact includes potential data theft or modification. CVSS 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template verifies the SQL injection by issuing two raw GET requests to `/student.php?action=delete&id=...`:

- Error-based probe: `id=1'+AND+EXTRACTVALUE(0x0a,CONCAT(0x0a,VERSION()))--+-` matching `status_code == 200` AND `contains(body, "XPATH syntax error")`.
- Time-based blind probe: `id=1'+AND+SLEEP(7)--+-` matching `duration >= 7` AND `status_code == 302` AND `contains(body, "login.php")`.

These probes confirm the injection point is exploitable for arbitrary SQL without performing data modification or destructive actions.
