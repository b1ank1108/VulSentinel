## Vulnerability
WordPress Frontend Login and Registration Blocks Plugin versions <= 1.0.7 contains a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2025-3605, CWE-639). An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the unprotected AJAX endpoint `flr_blocks_user_settings_handle_ajax_callback()` (action `flrblocksusersettingsupdatehandle`) to change the administrator account's email address (user_id=1). This enables a subsequent password reset via the built-in "Forgot Password" feature, resulting in full admin account takeover.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8).  
Impact: Complete unauthorized admin access.  
Remediation: Upgrade to version 1.0.8 or later to enforce authorization on user settings updates.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with parameters `action=flrblocksusersettingsupdatehandle&user_id=1&flr-blocks-email-update=<random_email>`. It verifies success via AND matchers for HTTP 200 status, `application/json` content-type, and response body containing both `"status":true` and `Operation has been completed successfully`. A DSL extractor captures the injected email value. This detection is intrusive and actually modifies the administrator email on vulnerable instances.
