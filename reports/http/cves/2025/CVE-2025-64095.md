## Vulnerability
DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) < 10.1.1 contains an unrestricted arbitrary file upload vulnerability caused by the default HTML editor provider allowing unauthenticated file uploads and overwriting existing files. Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files via the FileUploader.ashx endpoint, enabling website defacement and XSS payload injection.

**Impact:** Unauthenticated attackers can upload and overwrite files, leading to website defacement and cross-site scripting attacks.  
**Remediation:** Update to version 10.1.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST multipart/form-data request to `/Providers/HtmlEditorProviders/DNNConnect.CKE/Browser/FileUploader.ashx` with a randomly generated `*.png` filename and random file content, setting `storageFolderID=1`, `portalID=0`, `overrideFiles=1`, and `mode=Default`. It verifies the flaw by matching HTTP 200 status, `text/plain` content-type, and response body containing both `{"group"` and `delete_type`. This intrusive probe actually performs a file write operation.
