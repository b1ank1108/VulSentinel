## Vulnerability
ESPHome 2025.8.0 contains an authentication bypass in the web_server component caused by improper validation of base64-encoded Authorization header values. Attackers can access protected web server functions—including the dashboard and OTA updates—by supplying a crafted Authorization header without any valid credentials. Impact includes full unauthorized control of device configuration and updates. Fixed in 2025.8.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` and internally verifies a 401 response (confirming standard authentication enforcement). It then issues a second GET to `{{BaseURL}}/ ` with the header `Authorization: Basic` (empty value) and matches on both HTTP 200 status and the string "Dashboard - ESPHome" in the response body to confirm successful bypass and dashboard access.
