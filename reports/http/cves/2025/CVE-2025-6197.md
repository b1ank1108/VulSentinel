cve_id: CVE-2025-6197
template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2025/CVE-2025-6197.yaml
affected_product: Grafana OSS
severity: medium
authentication: required
external_callback: true
affected_versions: unknown
preconditions: [Multiple organizations must exist in the Grafana instance, Victim must be on a different organization than the one specified in the URL]
poc_classification: detect-only

## Vulnerability
An open redirect vulnerability exists in Grafana OSS organization switching functionality. Authenticated attackers can redirect users to arbitrary external domains through the organization switching endpoint, enabling phishing attacks and credential theft. Prerequisites for exploitation: multiple organizations must exist in the Grafana instance and the victim must be active in a different organization than the one specified in the malicious URL. Remediation requires upgrading Grafana OSS to the latest version that properly validates redirect URLs in the organization switching functionality.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only
The template authenticates by issuing a POST to `/login` with `{"user":"{{username}}","password":"{{password}}"}` (verifying success via 200 status, "Logged in" in body, and `grafana_session` cookie). It then sends GET `/ %2f%5coast.pro?orgId={{orgid}}` (crafted absolute URL), follows redirects, and confirms the flaw if status_code == 302 and the Location header contains `//oast.pro?`.
