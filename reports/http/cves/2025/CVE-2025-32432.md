## Vulnerability
CVE-2025-32432 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in CraftCMS caused by unsafe deserialization in the asset transform functionality. Unauthenticated attackers can achieve complete server compromise via a low-complexity attack vector. This is an additional fix for CVE-2023-41892.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L (score 10.0). CWE-94.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template performs a two-step HTTP interaction: a GET to `/index.php?p=admin/actions/assets/generate-transform` extracts the CSRF token via regex on the `csrfTokenValue` field; a subsequent POST to the same endpoint submits a JSON payload injecting a `GuzzleHttp\Psr7\FnStream` gadget (wrapped in `craft\behaviors\FieldLayoutBehavior` with `_fn_close: phpinfo`). Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 status and response body containing all of "PHP Extension", "PHP Version", and "CRAFT_".
