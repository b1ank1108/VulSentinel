## Vulnerability
Langflow AI <= 1.6.9 is affected by a critical CORS misconfiguration (CWE-942) that allows arbitrary origins to perform credentialed requests. Combined with SameSite=None cookies on authentication tokens, this enables cross-origin theft of session tokens and subsequent remote code execution via the /api/v1/validate/code endpoint.  
CVSS: 9.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template first sends a GET / request and internally matches the string "Langflow" in the response body to confirm the product. It then issues an OPTIONS /api/v1/refresh preflight request with Origin: https://scanme.sh, Access-Control-Request-Method: POST and Access-Control-Request-Headers: content-type. It verifies the response contains Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://scanme.sh and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true (status 200).
