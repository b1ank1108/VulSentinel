## Vulnerability
The Opal Estate Pro plugin (≤ 1.7.5) is vulnerable to privilege escalation. Due to missing role restrictions in the on_register_user function, users can register with any role. This allows unauthenticated attackers to create administrator accounts.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to register with administrator privileges, gaining complete control over the WordPress site.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first issues a GET request to `/` and extracts the `opalestate-register-nonce` value with regex from the response body. It then issues a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` containing random username/email/password values plus `role=administrator` and the extracted nonce. Success is confirmed when the response returns status code 200 and the body contains `"status\":true"`.
