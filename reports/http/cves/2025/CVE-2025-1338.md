## Vulnerability
NUUO Camera versions up to 20250203 contain an OS Command Injection vulnerability (CWE-78) caused by manipulation of the 'log' argument in /handle_config.php. Unauthenticated remote attackers can execute arbitrary system commands, potentially leading to full system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The nuclei template detects the vulnerability by sending a crafted GET request `GET /handle_config.php?log=;id; HTTP/1.1` and matching on status_code == 200 combined with response body containing "/mtd/block4/log/", "uid=", and "gid=" (evidence of successful `id` command execution).
