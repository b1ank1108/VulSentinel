## Vulnerability
Unauthenticated OS command injection (CWE-78) in usbinteract.cgi via unsanitized `path` parameter. Attacker-controlled input `action=7&path="|cmd||"` is passed directly to shell, executed as root.  
Impact: full remote system compromise (arbitrary code, data exfil, persistence).  
CVSS 4.0: 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H).  
Remediation: upgrade to 1.4.12+ (proper input sanitization in CGI).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
Template performs non-destructive probe: POST to `/web/cgi-bin/usbinteract.cgi` (or `/cgi-bin/usbinteract.cgi`) with `action=7&path="|id||"` and matches `uid=` regex + `Content-type: text/html` + 200 status in response body to confirm command execution as root.
