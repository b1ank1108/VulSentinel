## Vulnerability
A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the SQLConverterServlet component of ETQ Reliance CG (legacy) platform. Unsanitized user input in the `MySQLStm` parameter allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of an authenticated victim's browser session when a crafted link is visited. The servlet was unnecessarily exposed to authenticated users and has been disabled in version SE.2025.1. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first issues `GET /` and extracts the application base path from the `Location` redirect header (or defaults to `reliance`). It then issues `GET /<path>/SQLConverterServlet?MySQLStm=%3C/textarea%3E%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain)%3E` and verifies the vulnerability if the response body contains both the unsanitized payload string `</textarea><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>` **and** the application message `You have to start the ENGINE application before using this form.`.
