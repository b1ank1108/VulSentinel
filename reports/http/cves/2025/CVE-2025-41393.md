## Vulnerability

Ricoh Web Image Monitor, the web interface implemented in Ricoh laser printers and multifunction printers (MFPs), is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. User-supplied input to the `profile` query parameter is reflected unsanitized into the HTML response, enabling an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL.

Impact: Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript in user browsers through the profile parameter, potentially leading to session hijacking and credential theft.  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)  
CWE: CWE-79  
EPSS: 0.00621 (0.69702 percentile)  
Remediation: Apply the security patch from Ricoh for affected Web Image Monitor implementations.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/?profile=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. It matches on HTTP 200 status and confirms the payload is reflected unsanitized by checking for the exact strings `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`, `websys/webArch/mainFrame.cgi`, and `Web Image Monitor` all present in the response body.
