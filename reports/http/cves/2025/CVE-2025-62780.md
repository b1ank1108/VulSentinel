## Vulnerability
ChangeDetection.io <= v0.50.33 is affected by a stored XSS vulnerability (CWE-79, CVE-2025-62780) caused by insufficient sanitization in the Watch update API. Authenticated attackers can set the `url` field to a JavaScript payload (e.g. `javascript:alert(document.domain)`). When any user previews the watch, the payload executes in their browser context with the victim's privileges. CVSS 3.1: 6.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N). Impact includes session theft, credential exfiltration, or actions performed as the victim. Fixed in 0.50.34.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues GET / to fingerprint ChangeDetection.io, extract version (<= 0.50.33) via regex and the first watch UUID via XPath. It then issues GET /settings to extract the x-api-key value. Next it sends an authenticated PUT /api/v1/watch/{{uuid}} containing `{"url":"javascript:alert(document.domain)","title":"{{randstr}}","paused":true}` and confirms 200/OK. Finally it issues GET /preview/{{uuid}} and verifies both the JavaScript payload and random title appear unsanitized in the response body, confirming the stored XSS.
