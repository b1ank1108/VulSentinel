severity: high

preconditions: [knowledge of valid access key ID with WRITE permissions on target bucket, knowledge of bucket name]

## Vulnerability
MinIO object storage suffers from incomplete signature validation for S3-compatible uploads using unsigned-trailer payloads (STREAMING-UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD-TRAILER). An attacker with a valid access key ID that holds WRITE permissions on a bucket can upload arbitrary objects by supplying any invalid signature (e.g., Signature=test), bypassing secret-key verification while still leveraging the access-key ID and bucket WRITE grant.

Impact includes compromise of data integrity and availability via unauthorized object uploads. Fixed in RELEASE.2025-04-03T14-56-28Z. Template is intrusive (actual upload occurs).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template performs a direct raw PUT to `/{{bucket}}/{{randstr}}.txt` with headers `x-amz-content-sha256: STREAMING-UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD-TRAILER`, `Authorization` containing `Credential={{access_key_id}}/... Signature=test`, chunked Transfer-Encoding, X-Amz-Trailer, and a bogus 8-byte payload + trailer. Vulnerability is confirmed if the server responds with HTTP 200 and contains both `x-amz-id` and `x-amz-request-id` headers, proving the upload succeeded despite invalid signature. Requires supplied `bucket` and `access_key_id` parameters.
