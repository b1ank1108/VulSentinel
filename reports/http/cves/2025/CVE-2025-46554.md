## Vulnerability
A vulnerability in XWiki's REST API allows unauthenticated users to access the attachments list and metadata through the attachments endpoint. This could lead to disclosure of sensitive information stored in attachments metadata.

**Impact**  
Unauthenticated users can access attachment lists and metadata through the REST API attachments endpoint, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Remediation**  
Upgrade to the latest XWiki version that implements proper authorization checks for the attachments REST API endpoint.

**CVSS**  
7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  
**CWE**  
CWE-285

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/rest/wikis/xwiki/spaces/Sandbox/pages/WebHome/attachments` (and the variant path prefixed with `xwiki/`). It verifies exploitation success by matching HTTP status 200, a `Content-Type` header containing `text/xml` or `text/javascript`, and the response body containing the XML elements `<attachments`, `<item`, and `<longSize>`.
