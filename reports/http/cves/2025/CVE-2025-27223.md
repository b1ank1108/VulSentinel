## Vulnerability

TRUfusion Enterprise <= 7.10.4.0 is vulnerable to an authentication bypass due to a hard-coded cryptographic key. This allows forging of session cookies that can be used to completely bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access with arbitrary user privileges.

**Impact**  
Attackers can forge session cookies using hard-coded cryptographic keys to completely bypass authentication, gaining unauthorized access to the system with arbitrary user privileges.

**Remediation**  
Upgrade TRUfusion Enterprise to one of the following secure releases: 7.10.3.1, 7.10.1.1, 7.10.1.0, 7.10.3.0, 7.9.6.1, 7.9.6.0, 7.9.5.0, 7.9.4.0, 7.9.3.1, 7.9.3.0, 7.9.2.1, 7.10.2.0, or 7.10.0.1.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a GET request to `/trufusionPortal/getProjectList?userId=1` with the hardcoded cookie `COOKIELANG=de; COOKIEID=FEF2DF1C36FFF2E3;`. It verifies successful exploitation by checking that the response body contains both `"profileName":` and `"name":`, the content-type is `application/json`, and the status code is 200.
