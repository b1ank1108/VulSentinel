## Vulnerability

XWiki's REST API contains an improper authorization vulnerability (CWE-285) allowing unauthenticated access to private page information and metadata via the pages endpoint. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5). Impact includes exposure of sensitive page summaries and content details that should be restricted. Remediation requires upgrading XWiki to a version with fixed authorization checks on the REST API.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs detection by issuing unauthenticated GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/rest/wikis/xwiki/pages?space=` (and the variant with `/xwiki/` prefix). It matches on the presence of XML-like page elements (`<pageSummary`, `<pages`, `<xwikiRelativeUr`) in the response body combined with `text/xml` or `text/javascript` Content-Type headers and HTTP 200 status to confirm the endpoint discloses private page data without authentication.
