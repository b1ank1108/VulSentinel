## Vulnerability
LibreChat <= 0.7.9 contains a stored XSS (CWE-79, HTML injection) due to improper sanitization of the Accept-Language header. The payload is inserted directly into the `<html lang="">` attribute. Exploit requires the attacker to be logged in. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 5.4). Impact: logged-in attackers can inject arbitrary HTML leading to cross-site scripting that may compromise user sessions or data.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/`, injecting `<h3>{{rand_base(20)}}</h3>` in the Accept-Language header. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 if the response body simultaneously contains the unsanitized marker inside the lang attribute **and** the string "LibreChat".
