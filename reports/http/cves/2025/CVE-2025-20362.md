## Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the VPN web server of Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to access restricted URL endpoints related to remote access VPN that should be inaccessible without authentication. Root cause is improper validation of user-supplied input in HTTP(S) requests. Successful exploitation permits access to otherwise protected URLs. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.5, Medium). CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass
The template issues a single raw POST request to the path `/+CSCOU+//../+CSCOE+/files/file_action.html?mode=upload&path=foo&server=srv&sourceurl=qaz` (using directory traversal and specially crafted query parameters to target a restricted file-action endpoint) with a minimal `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` body. It detects the bypass by matching HTTP 200 status together with the response body containing either `<script>alert('CSRF token mismatch')` or `Failed to upload file`, confirming the protected endpoint was reached and processed without authentication.
