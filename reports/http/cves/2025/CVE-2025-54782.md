## Vulnerability
NestJS DevTools Integration (@nestjs/devtools-integration package) versions 0.2.0 and below expose an unprotected local development HTTP server. The /inspector/graph/interact endpoint accepts a JSON `code` field and executes it inside a Node.js `vm.runInNewContext` sandbox that is insufficiently restricted (safe-eval-like). Missing cross-origin protections allow any malicious website visited by a developer to POST arbitrary code, which escapes the sandbox and gains full Node.js privileges on the developer’s local machine. Impact includes arbitrary command execution (CWE-77, CWE-78) and CSRF-style abuse (CWE-352). Fixed in 0.2.1. CVSS 4.0 score 9.4 (AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single unauthenticated POST to `/inspector/graph/interact` with a specially crafted payload that (1) escapes the sandbox via `propertyIsEnumerable.call()` error handling, (2) obtains the `process` object, and (3) runs `child_process.execSync('nslookup {{interactsh-url}}')`. Detection succeeds when a DNS interaction is observed on the interactsh server, the response `content-type` is `application/plain`, and the HTTP status is 200.
