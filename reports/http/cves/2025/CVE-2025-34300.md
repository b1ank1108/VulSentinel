## Vulnerability
A pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability exists in SawtoothSoftware Lighthouse Studio versions prior to 9.16.14. The flaw originates from unsafe direct use of Perl’s `eval` function inside the CGI component `ciwweb.pl`, where attacker-controlled data supplied in the `hid_Random_ACARAT` parameter is evaluated as code. Impact: unauthenticated remote attackers can execute arbitrary Perl code on the server, resulting in full system compromise. CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). CWE: CWE-1336, CWE-20.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues a single GET request to `/cgi-bin/ciwweb.pl?hid_javascript=1&hid_Random_ACARAT=[%25{{num1}}*{{num2}}%25]&hid_Random_ACARAT=x` (where `num1`/`num2` are random integers in 40000-44800 and `result` is their product). It matches on HTTP 200 and the exact string `name="hid_Random_ACARAT" value="{{result}}"` appearing in the response body, confirming that the server performed the `eval` of the injected expression.
