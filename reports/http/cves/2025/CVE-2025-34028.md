## Vulnerability
A path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in Commvault Command Center Innovation Release permits an unauthenticated actor to upload ZIP files containing path traversal sequences. Server-side expansion of these files triggers SSRF, resulting in remote code execution. This issue affects Command Center Innovation Release: 11.38.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H (score 10.0).  
Unauthenticated attackers can exploit SSRF through ZIP file uploads, potentially achieving full remote code execution on the Commvault server.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template performs a single raw POST to `/commandcenter/deployWebpackage.do` (form-urlencoded) with `commcellName` set to a unique `{{interactsh-url}}`, a random lowercase 5-char `servicePack` value, and `version=x`. It verifies success when an out-of-band HTTP or DNS callback is observed on interactsh **and** the server returns HTTP status 900.
