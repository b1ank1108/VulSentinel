## Vulnerability
The Events Calendar WordPress plugin <= 6.15.2 contains an information disclosure vulnerability caused by REST endpoint exposure. Unauthenticated attackers can extract data about password-protected organizers (vendors) and venues.

Impact: Unauthenticated attackers can access sensitive information about password-protected vendors or venues.

Remediation: Update to the latest version beyond 6.15.2.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs unauthenticated GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json/tribe/events/v1/organizers` and `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json/tribe/events/v1/venues`. It verifies exposure via status_code == 200, presence of `rest_url`/`total` fields and either `organizers` or `venues` in the JSON body, and `application/json` Content-Type header. Regex extractors capture `organizer_data` and `venue_data` arrays to confirm leaked content.
