## Vulnerability
The Events Manager - Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the 'orderby' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.0.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

**CVSS:** 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE:** CWE-89  

**Impact:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform time-based SQL injection attacks, potentially extracting sensitive information from the database including user credentials, personal information, and other confidential data.  

**Remediation:** Update the Events Manager plugin to version 6.6.5 or 7.0.4 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the payload `action=search_events&orderby=1*(select(sleep(8)))` (30s timeout) and confirms exploitation success if response duration >=8 seconds, status_code==200, and body contains all of `'em-item-info'`, `'em-item-title'`, `'em-item-desc'`.
