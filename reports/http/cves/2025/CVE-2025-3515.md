## Vulnerability
The Contact Form 7 Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload WordPress plugin (all versions up to and including 1.3.8.9) is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload due to insufficient file type validation. Unauthenticated attackers can bypass the plugin's blacklist and upload .phar or other dangerous file types. This can lead to remote code execution on servers configured to execute .phar files as PHP scripts, particularly default Apache+mod_php setups.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 8.1). CWE-434.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template verifies exploitability through a multi-step process: discovers the upload form by GET requests to common paths (e.g., /contact/, /contact-us/) and extracts `upload_name`, `nonce` (ajax_nonce), and `form_id` via regex from HTML containing `wpcf7-drag-n-drop-file`; performs a POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with multipart payload (action: dnd_codedropz_upload) uploading a test file named `*.&#112;har` (`.phar` with HTML entity) containing a unique marker string; confirms success by GETting the uploaded file from the predictable path `/wp-content/uploads/wp_dndcf7_uploads/wpcf7-files/` and matching the marker. Fallback version detection parses `/readme.txt` for "Stable tag:" <= 1.3.8.9. Detection involves actual file upload and retrieval.
