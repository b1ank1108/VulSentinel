## Vulnerability
XWiki is affected by a critical SQL injection (CWE-89) in the REST API query endpoint (CVE-2025-32969). Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL/HQL queries by manipulating the `q` parameter, resulting in data exfiltration, complete database compromise, and potential system takeover (CVSS 9.8: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template performs time-based blind SQLi detection by sending a GET request to `/rest/wikis/xwiki/query?q=where%20doc.name=length(%27a%27)*org.apache.logging.log4j.util.Chars.SPACE%20or%201%3C%3E%271%5C%27%27%20union%20select%201,2,3,sleep(7)%20%23%27&type=hql&distinct=0`. It matches on response duration >=7s, status_code==200, body containing "WikiManager" and "<?xml", and content_type containing "text/javascript".
