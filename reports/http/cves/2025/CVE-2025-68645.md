## Vulnerability

Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) versions 10.0 and 10.1 suffer from a Local File Inclusion vulnerability caused by improper handling of the `javax.servlet.include.servlet_path` parameter in the RestFilter servlet. Unauthenticated remote attackers can include and read arbitrary files located in the WebRoot directory through specially crafted requests to endpoints under `/h/`.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the LFI by sending GET requests to 13 different paths (starting with `/h/rest` and including `/h/changepass`, `/h/imessage`, `/h/printcalendar`, etc.) appended with `?javax.servlet.include.servlet_path=/WEB-INF/web.xml`. Success is confirmed on HTTP 200 responses containing the strings `<?xml version`, `web-app>`, and `Zimbra` in the body, indicating the web.xml file was included.
