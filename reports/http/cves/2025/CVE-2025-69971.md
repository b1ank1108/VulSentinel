## Vulnerability
FUXA <= 1.2.7 contains a hardcoded credentials vulnerability caused by use of a hard-coded secret key in `server/api/jwt-helper.js`. Remote attackers can forge valid admin JWT tokens and bypass authentication with no special conditions required. Impact: full administrative access to the SCADA/industrial automation platform. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-321.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single GET request to `/api/project` supplying a pre-forged admin JWT token in the `x-access-token` header. It confirms the bypass if status_code == 200, Content-Type contains `application/json`, and the JSON body contains the strings `"hmi"`, `"server"`, and `FuxaServer`.
