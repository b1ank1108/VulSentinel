## Vulnerability

Microweber CMS 2.0 contains a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `id` parameter of the `live_edit.module_settings` API endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of victim browsers. The flaw stems from improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when accessing the live_edit module settings interface. Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or other client-side attacks against authenticated users who are tricked into accessing a malicious URL.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-step detection process:

1. **Authentication**: Sends a POST request to `/api/user_login` with credentials to establish an authenticated session. Validates successful login by checking for HTTP 200 status, JSON content type, and response body containing success indicators and username fields.

2. **XSS Verification**: Issues a GET request to `/api/live_edit/live_edit.module_settings` with a crafted XSS payload (`</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`) injected into the `id` parameter. The template confirms the vulnerability by verifying:
   - HTTP 200 response status
   - HTML content type in the response
   - Presence of the unescaped XSS payload in the response body alongside expected page content ("Add Country</a>")

The detection confirms that the injected JavaScript is reflected in the HTML response without proper sanitization, demonstrating the exploitable XSS condition.
