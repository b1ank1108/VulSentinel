## Vulnerability
Evertz SDVN 3080ipx-10G high-bandwidth Ethernet switching fabric exposes a PHP-based web management interface (using webEASY SDK/'ewb') on port 80 vulnerable to authentication bypass and arbitrary command injection. Two endpoints are affected: login.php (for auth bypass via crafted authorized parameter) and feature-transfer-export.php (for command injection). Unauthenticated remote attackers can achieve root-level arbitrary command execution, enabling media streaming interruption, content modification, or closed caption alteration.

CVSS v4.0 score 9.3 (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/S:N/AU:Y/V:C).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template verifies the vulnerability through a two-step HTTP interaction:  
1. Issues a GET request to `/login.php?authorized={{base64(payload)}}` using a specially crafted JSON payload that impersonates an administrator role to bypass authentication and establish a session (matched internally via PHPSESSID and webeasy-loggedin cookies).  
2. Follows with a GET to `/v.1.5/php/features/feature-transfer-export.php?action=id;&filename=&varid=&slot=` to inject the `id` command.  

Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 responses containing Linux `id` command output patterns (`uid=`, `gid=`, `groups=`).
