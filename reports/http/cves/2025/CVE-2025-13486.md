## Vulnerability
Advanced Custom Fields Extended WordPress plugin versions 0.9.0.5 through 0.9.1.1 contain a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-13486) caused by unsafe use of `call_user_func_array()` in the `prepare_form()` function. Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code remotely via the `acfe/form/render_form_ajax` endpoint.  
**Impact:** Full compromise including backdoor installation or administrator account creation.  
**CVSS 3.1:** 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE:** CWE-94  
**Remediation:** Update beyond 0.9.1.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template verifies the vulnerability through a chained HTTP flow that exploits the flaw:  
- GET `/` extracts the ACF nonce via regex match on `acf.data.*?"nonce":"([a-f0-9]+)"` in the page body.  
- POST `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` (action=acfe/form/render_form_ajax) supplies `form[render]=wp_insert_user`, random admin credentials, and the nonce to trigger arbitrary function execution and create a new administrator account.  
- POST `/wp-login.php` (log/pwd of the newly created user) confirms success with status 302 and `wordpress_logged_in` cookie presence.  
The random credentials are extracted on success as proof-of-concept output.
