## Vulnerability
FOGProject <= 1.5.10.1673 suffers from an authentication bypass (CVE-2025-58443, CWE-287). Unauthenticated remote attackers can reach the management interface without credentials, exposing system configuration, host management, and potentially database contents.  
CVSS 3.1: 9.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).  
Impact includes full read access to administrative data.  
Remediation requires upgrading beyond 1.5.10.1673 to enforce authentication on all management endpoints.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template first issues a GET to `{{BaseURL}}` (internal matcher) to confirm the FOG application signature (`FOG` string + 200). It then dispatches two parallel GETs: one to `/fog/management/index.php?node=about&sub=kernel` and one to `/fog/service/getversion.php?url={{interactsh-url}}`. Success is confirmed by either a 200 response containing kernel/configuration regex patterns or a DNS interaction callback on the interactsh domain, proving unauthenticated reachability of protected endpoints.
