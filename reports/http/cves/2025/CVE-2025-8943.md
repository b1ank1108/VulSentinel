## Vulnerability
Flowise versions before 3.0.1 contain a critical unauthenticated remote command execution flaw (CWE-78) in the Custom MCPs feature. The `/api/v1/node-load-method/customMCP` endpoint executes unsandboxed OS commands (e.g. via `npx` for local MCP servers). Default installations ship with no authentication and no RBAC, enabling unauthenticated network attackers to inject and run arbitrary commands.

CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
Impact: complete system compromise, data theft, lateral movement.  
Remediation: upgrade to 3.0.1+, enforce input validation/sanitization on customMCP parameters and enable authentication.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues a single POST request to `/api/v1/node-load-method/customMCP` (Content-Type: application/json, x-request-from: internal) containing a JSON body that sets `mcpServerConfig.command` to `"ping"`, `args` to `["{{interactsh-url}}", "-c", "4"]`, and `loadMethod` to `"listActions"`. Detection confirms success when an out-of-band DNS interaction is received on interactsh together with HTTP/200, JSON content-type, and response body containing both `"No Available Actions"` and `"label\":"`.
