## Vulnerability
Twonky Server 8.5.2 on Linux and Windows contains a broken access control vulnerability in its web service API (`/nmc/rpc/log_getfile`). This flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass authentication entirely and retrieve log files that expose administrator usernames and encrypted passwords.

**Impact**: Direct disclosure of admin credentials from server logs, enabling account takeover or further compromise.  
**Remediation**: Restrict access to the Twonky Server web service API or implement network segmentation (no vendor fix released).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues an unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/nmc/rpc/log_getfile`. Detection succeeds on HTTP status code 200 combined with the presence of log markers ("server_main_impl", "LOG_SYSTEM:", "upnp_ini_file") in the body. Regex extractors pull the administrator username (`accessuser =([ a-zA-Z0-9]+)`) and encrypted password (`accesspwd =([ :a-zA-Z0-9]+)`) directly from the leaked log content.
