## Vulnerability
Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in MagnusSolution MagnusBilling login logging component (protected/components/MagnusLog.Php) due to improper input neutralization. Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript via the `user` parameter in a failed login POST to `/mbilling/index.php/authentication/login`; the payload is stored unsanitized in the log component viewable by administrators at `/mbilling/index.php/logUsers/read`. 

Affects all versions through 7.3.0 (fixed in 7.3.1). CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N (score 8.2), CWE-79. Impact includes session hijacking and privilege escalation when administrators view the logs.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

Template performs a 4-step flow to verify the flaw: (1) POSTs to login endpoint with XSS payload (`<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`) in the `user` field to trigger unauthenticated storage in failed-login logs, (2) authenticates as administrative user `root` using provided credentials, (3) confirms successful authentication via `/authentication/check`, (4) GETs `/logUsers/read` and matches for the exact unsanitized payload string in the JSON response body. This confirms unauthorized modification and persistence of attacker-controlled HTML content.
