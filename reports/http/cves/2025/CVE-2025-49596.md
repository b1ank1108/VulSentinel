## Vulnerability
MCP Inspector is a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers. Versions below 0.14.0 are vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution because there is no authentication between the Inspector client and its proxy component. This allows any remote attacker to issue arbitrary MCP commands over the stdio transport channel.

**Impact:** Full remote code execution without credentials or user interaction.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade immediately to 0.14.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first requests the root endpoint to confirm the application title contains “MCP Inspector” and extracts the path to the main JavaScript bundle. It then fetches that bundle, parses the embedded `const version` string, and internally verifies the version satisfies `< 0.14.0`. Finally it issues a GET request to `/sse?transportType=stdio&command=echo&args[]=hello-from-brower`. The response is matched for status 200 plus the presence of both an `endpoint` reference and a `/message?sessionId=` value; the extracted session ID serves as direct proof that an unauthenticated command was successfully processed by the stdio proxy.
