## Vulnerability
Yonyou YonBIP v3 and before contains a path traversal vulnerability caused by improper validation of the `ticket` parameter in the LoginWithV8 interface of the series data application service system. Unauthorized attackers can read arbitrary files on the server (e.g. Windows system files), leading to information disclosure of sensitive configuration data.  

Impact: Exposure of sensitive system information that may enable further attacks.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5).  
Remediation: Update to a version beyond v3.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  

The template detects the flaw by sending a single unauthenticated GET request to `/bi/api/Portal/LoginWithV8/?ticket=/../../../../Windows/win.ini` and checking for a 200 OK response whose body contains Windows INI file markers (`[fonts]`, `[extensions]`, `Message`).
