## Vulnerability
mojoPortal <=2.9.0.1 is vulnerable to directory traversal in the BetterImageGallery API Controller's ImageHandler action. Unauthenticated attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, including the Web.Config file to extract the MachineKey. This can enable subsequent authentication bypass and remote code execution.

CVSS 3.1 score: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N). CWE-284.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the vulnerability by sending a single GET request to `/api/BetterImageGallery/imagehandler?path=../../../Web.Config` and verifying a 200 OK response containing both the strings `<machineKey` and `<system.web>` in the body.
