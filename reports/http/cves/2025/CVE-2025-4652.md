## Vulnerability
Broadstreet WordPress plugin < 1.51.8 contains a reflected XSS caused by unsanitised and unescaped `next` parameter output in `/wp-content/plugins/broadstreet/Broadstreet/Vendor/broadstreet-partner/index.php?action=register`. Attackers can craft malicious URLs to execute arbitrary scripts in the browser context of high-privilege users (e.g. admins), enabling session hijacking or privilege abuse. Exploit requires victim interaction. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first performs an internal POST login to `/wp-login.php` (using `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials) and verifies the `wordpress_logged_in` cookie to establish an authenticated session. It then sends a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint embedding the payload `id=123&next="/><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. Detection succeeds on status 200 combined with the unsanitized script tag and "broadstreet" string present in the response body.
