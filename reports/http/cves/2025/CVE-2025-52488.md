## Vulnerability

DNN (DotNetNuke) versions 6.0.0 to before 10.0.1 suffers from a Unicode Path Normalization NTLM Hash Disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2025-52488, CWE-200). Unauthenticated attackers can abuse Windows NET quirks and Unicode normalization during file uploads to the DNNConnect.CKE FileUploader.ashx endpoint. Maliciously crafted filenames containing fullwidth Unicode characters normalize into UNC paths, forcing the server to connect to an attacker-controlled SMB server and disclose NTLM hashes of the application account or domain credentials.

CVSS 3.1: 8.6 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N). Impact includes potential credential theft and lateral movement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single raw POST multipart request to `/Providers/HtmlEditorProviders/DNNConnect.CKE/Browser/FileUploader.ashx?PortalID=0&storageFolderID=1&overrideFiles=false` with a file named using decoded Unicode payload incorporating an interactsh URL (e.g. fullwidth equivalents of \\{{interactsh-url}}\\c$\\an.jpg). Detection succeeds on DNS interaction via interactsh_protocol and presence of DNN indicators in the HTTP response (dnn_ismobile cookie or body keywords like "dotnetnuke", "dnnconnect").
