## Vulnerability

WebTitan before version 3.60 suffers from a directory traversal vulnerability in `logs-x.php` (view action). Authenticated remote users can read arbitrary files by injecting `..` sequences into the `fname` parameter, such as to access `/etc/passwd`. This LFI can expose sensitive information including database credentials and configuration data.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first retrieves the login page, then submits credentials via POST to `/login-x.php` to authenticate, followed by a GET request to `/logs-x.php?jaction=view&fname=../../../../../etc/passwd`. It verifies exploitation by confirming login success and the presence of root user entries (`root:.*:0:0:`) in the response body indicating successful file inclusion.
