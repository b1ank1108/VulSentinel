## Vulnerability
Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware 7.0 is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in `snarf_ajax.php` through unsanitized handling of the GET `ajax` parameter.

An attacker can craft a malicious URL that injects JavaScript payloads, which execute in the victim's browser upon visiting the link. CVSS 3.1 score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), CWE-79. Impact includes session hijacking, page defacement, and sensitive information theft.

Remediation involves upgrading to a patched version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a detection by issuing a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/snarf_ajax.php?url=1&ajax=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`, injecting a breakout payload. It verifies exploitation potential by confirming the exact unsanitized payload string appears in the response body, alongside HTTP 200 status and text/html content-type.
