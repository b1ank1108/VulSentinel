## Vulnerability
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in `clickdesk.php` of the ClickDesk Live Support Live Chat WordPress plugin 2.0. Remote unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `cdwidgetid` parameter (CWE-79).  

CVSSv2: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N).  
Impact: Malicious scripts execute in victims’ browsers, enabling session hijacking, page defacement, or theft of sensitive information (cookies, form data).  
Remediation: Update to latest patched version per official changelog.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  

The template verifies the flaw with two sequential HTTP requests:  
1. Internal fingerprint: `GET /wp-content/plugins/clickdesk-live-support-chat/readme.txt` matches word “ClickDesk Live Support - Live Chat” to confirm plugin presence.  
2. Reflected-XSS probe: `GET {{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/clickdesk-live-support-chat/clickdesk.php?cdwidgetid=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` checks that the exact unsanitized payload appears in the response body, Content-Type is `text/html`, and status is 200.
