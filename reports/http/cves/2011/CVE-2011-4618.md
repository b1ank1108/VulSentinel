## Vulnerability
Advanced Text Widget is a WordPress plugin vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in versions before 2.0.2. The flaw resides in `advancedtext.php` where the `page` parameter is reflected without sanitization, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML (CWE-79).  
CVSS 2.0: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N). Impact includes session hijacking, page defacement, or theft of sensitive information executed in the victim's browser context. Remediation: upgrade to 2.0.2 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET to `/wp-content/plugins/advanced-text-widget/readme.txt` and confirms the plugin via string match for "Advanced Text Widget". It then sends a second GET to `/wp-content/plugins/advanced-text-widget/advancedtext.php?page=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies the unsanitized XSS payload appears verbatim in the HTML response body (status 200 + text/html).
