## Vulnerability
Directory traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability (Bug IDs CSCth09343, CSCts44049) in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) 5.x/6.x <6.1(5)SU2, 7.x <7.1(5b)SU2, 8.x <8.0(3), Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX), and Unified IP Interactive Voice Response (Unified IP-IVR) allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files via crafted URL to the IVRGetAudioFile.do endpoint. CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N (score 7.8). Impact: access to sensitive files and directories on the affected system. Remediation: upgrade to patched versions.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/ccmivr/IVRGetAudioFile.do?file=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` and confirms the flaw if the response has status 200 and matches regex `root:.*:0:0:` (indicating successful /etc/passwd disclosure).
