## Vulnerability

CVE-2011-5265 is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Featurific For WordPress plugin version 1.6.2. The vulnerability exists in the `cached_image.php` file, which fails to properly sanitize the `snum` parameter before reflecting it in the HTTP response. This allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML code into the application. Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, website defacement, or theft of sensitive information. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v2.0 score of 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N), indicating network-accessible exploitation with medium complexity, no authentication required, and impact limited to integrity.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs a two-stage detection process:

1. **Plugin Verification**: The template first sends a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/featurific-for-wordpress/readme.txt` to verify the presence of the Featurific For WordPress plugin by checking for the string "Featurific For Wordpress" in the response.

2. **XSS Vulnerability Detection**: If the plugin is detected, the template sends a second GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/featurific-for-wordpress/cached_image.php` with a crafted `snum` parameter containing an XSS payload: `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. The template verifies the vulnerability by checking for:
   - The reflected XSS payload in the response body
   - A `text/html` content-type header
   - An HTTP 200 status code

The template uses a harmless proof-of-concept payload (`alert(document.domain)`) to confirm that user-supplied input is reflected without proper sanitization, demonstrating the exploitability of the XSS vulnerability.
