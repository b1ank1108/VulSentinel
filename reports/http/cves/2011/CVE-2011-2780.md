## Vulnerability

Chyrp 2.0 and earlier contains a directory traversal vulnerability in `includes/lib/gz.php`. Remote unauthenticated attackers can read arbitrary files by supplying `..` sequences in the `file` parameter (distinct from CVE-2011-2744).  

**Impact**  
Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive files (e.g. `/etc/passwd`), which can enable remote code execution and full system compromise.  

**CVSS 2.0**  
5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)  
**CWE**  
CWE-22  

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak  

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/includes/lib/gz.php?file=/themes/../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` and verifies exploitation by matching HTTP status 200 together with the regex pattern `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body, confirming that `/etc/passwd` was successfully traversed and returned.
