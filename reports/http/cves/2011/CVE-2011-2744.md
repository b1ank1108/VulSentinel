## Vulnerability
Chyrp 2.x is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2011-2744, CWE-22) in versions 2.1 and earlier. Remote attackers can include and execute arbitrary local files via a `..%2F` (encoded dot-dot-slash) sequence in the `action` parameter to the default URI.

CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P (score 6.8). CPE: `cpe:2.3:a:chyrp:chyrp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*`

Impact: Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential remote code execution, or full system compromise.

Remediation: Upgrade Chyrp to the latest version or apply vendor-supplied patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/?action=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%00` and confirms the LFI by matching the regex `root:.*:0:0:` (indicating /etc/passwd contents) in the HTTP 200 response body.
