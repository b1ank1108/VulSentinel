## Vulnerability
A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in skysa-official/skysa.php of the Skysa App Bar Integration plugin for WordPress (possibly before 1.04). Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the submit parameter.  
CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N (score 4.3)  
CWE-79  
Successful exploitation allows execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser context, enabling session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.  
Remediation requires upgrading to a patched version or adding input sanitization to block XSS payloads.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template first performs internal fingerprinting by requesting /wp-content/plugins/skysa-official/readme.txt and confirming the presence of the string "Skysa App". It then sends a GET request to /wp-content/plugins/skysa-official/skysa.php?submit=</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script> (URL-encoded) and verifies exploitation by checking that the response returns status 200, Content-Type text/html, and the exact unescaped payload reflected in the body.
