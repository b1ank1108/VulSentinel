## Vulnerability
Apache Tomcat 4.x through 7.x contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2007-2449, CWE-79). An attacker can craft a malicious URL that causes arbitrary JavaScript to execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the vulnerable site.

Impact: session hijacking, page defacement, or malicious redirection.  
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 7.2).  
Remediation: apply latest vendor security patches and updates.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/examples/jsp/snp/snoop.jsp;<script>alert(document.domain)</script>test.jsp` and verifies reflected XSS by confirming the unsanitized payload appears verbatim in the server response body (Request URI line), alongside HTTP 200 status and text/html Content-Type.
