## Vulnerability
Cisco IOS HTTP server (versions 11.3 to 12.2) allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands when local authorization is enabled, by specifying a high access level (e.g. level 16) directly in the URL path. CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). CVSS v2: 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C). Successful exploitation results in full unauthorized device access and configuration exposure.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/level/16/exec/show/config/CR` and confirms exploitation success via HTTP status 200 combined with the AND presence of configuration strings 'service config', 'Switch', and 'default-gateway' in the response body.
