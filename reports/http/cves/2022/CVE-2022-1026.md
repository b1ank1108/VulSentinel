## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-1026 is an information exposure vulnerability affecting Kyocera Net View software running on Kyocera multifunction printers. The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls on the address book export function (CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials). Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this flaw to export the printer's address book, which contains sensitive user information including usernames and passwords. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.6 (High severity) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation requiring no privileges or user interaction, with high confidentiality impact. The EPSS score of 0.86782 (99.409th percentile) indicates a very high probability of active exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated SOAP request to the `/ws/km-wsdl/setting/address_book` endpoint. The request invokes the `create_personal_address_enumeration` action with a parameter requesting 25 address book entries. The template verifies the vulnerability by checking for:

1. A valid SOAP envelope response containing both `SOAP-ENV:Envelope` and `SOAP-ENV:Body` elements
2. A `text/xml` content type in the response
3. An HTTP 200 status code

A successful match indicates the printer responds to unauthenticated address book enumeration requests, confirming the presence of the vulnerability. The actual exploitation would involve parsing the returned SOAP response to extract sensitive user credentials from the address book data.
