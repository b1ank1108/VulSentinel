## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-29081 is a critical access control bypass vulnerability affecting multiple Zoho ManageEngine products: Access Manager Plus (versions before 4302), Password Manager Pro (versions before 12007), and PAM360 (versions before 5401). The vulnerability stems from improper access control validation on several REST API endpoints, allowing unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms using path traversal techniques with the `../RestAPI` substring.

The affected REST API endpoints include SSOutAction, SSLAction, LicenseMgr, GetProductDetails, GetDashboard, FetchEvents, and Synchronize. By exploiting this flaw, attackers can access sensitive functionality and data without proper authentication, leading to unauthorized information disclosure and potential system manipulation. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) and carries a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8, indicating critical severity with network-based attack vector, low complexity, and no privileges or user interaction required.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects this vulnerability by attempting to bypass access controls on the REST API endpoint. It sends a POST request to `/x/..//RestAPI/LicenseMgr` with the operation parameter set to `getLicenseDetails`. The path traversal sequence (`/x/..//`) is used to circumvent access control checks that would normally protect the RestAPI endpoints.

The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for a 200 HTTP status code and the presence of specific JSON response fields in the body: `BUILD_NO`, `LICENSE_TO`, `VERSION`, and `PRODUCT_NAME`. These fields indicate that the LicenseMgr API endpoint was successfully accessed without authentication, confirming the access control bypass. The successful retrieval of license details demonstrates that an unauthenticated attacker can access protected REST API functionality that should require proper authorization.
