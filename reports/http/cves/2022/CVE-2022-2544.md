## Vulnerability

WordPress Ninja Job Board < 1.3.3 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated direct request issue. The plugin does not protect the directory where it stores uploaded resumes (`/wp-content/uploads/wpjobboard/`), enabling unauthenticated directory listing and direct download of sensitive resume files.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5)  
CWE-425: Direct Request.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/wp/wp-content/uploads/wpjobboard/` and `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/uploads/wpjobboard/` (stop-at-first-match). It confirms the vulnerability by matching a 200 status code, `text/html` Content-Type header, and the presence of either "Index of /wp/wp-content/uploads/wpjobboard" or "Index of /wp-content/uploads/wpjobboard" in the response body.
