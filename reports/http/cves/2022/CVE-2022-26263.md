## Vulnerability
Yonyou U8 13.0 is affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability via the /u8sl/WebHelp component. An attacker can inject arbitrary scripts that execute in the context of an unsuspecting user's browser, allowing theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, defacement, or other attacks.

CVSS v3.1: 6.1 Medium (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE: CWE-79

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The detection template launches a headless browser to load the endpoint `/U8SL/WebHelp/PB_Por_zh-CN.htm` with a specially crafted `wvstest` parameter containing a JavaScript XSS payload. It then waits for page load and matches for evidence of successful payload execution in the DOM (specific injected frame source containing `console.log(document.domain)` and reference to `webhelp4.js`).
