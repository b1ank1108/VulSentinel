## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-29014 is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability affecting the Razer Sila Gaming Router firmware version 2.0.441_api-2.0.418. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files from the router's filesystem through the `/ubus/` endpoint. The flaw exists in the file read functionality exposed via the ubus JSON-RPC interface, which fails to properly validate or restrict file path parameters. Successful exploitation enables attackers to access sensitive system files, potentially exposing credentials, configuration data, and other confidential information stored on the device. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 (High severity) with an attack vector that requires no authentication, low attack complexity, and no user interaction.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a POST request to the `/ubus/` endpoint with a JSON-RPC payload that attempts to read the `/etc/passwd` file. The request uses the ubus `file.read` method with a hardcoded session token and specifies the target file path as `/etc/passwd`. The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for two conditions: (1) the HTTP response status is 200, and (2) the response body contains a regex pattern matching typical `/etc/passwd` entries (specifically looking for the root user entry with the pattern `root:.*:0:0:`). This detection method confirms that the router's ubus interface allows unauthorized file system access without proper authentication or path validation.
