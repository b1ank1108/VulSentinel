## Vulnerability
WordPress Sensei LMS plugin before 4.5.0 is susceptible to information disclosure. The plugin does not have proper permissions set in a REST endpoint, allowing unauthenticated attackers to access private Sensei LMS messages via unprotected REST API endpoints, potentially exposing confidential student-teacher communications.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the issue by fuzzing numeric IDs with GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json/wp/v2/sensei-messages/{{num}}` (payloads from helpers/wordlists/numbers.txt, stop-at-first-match). It identifies vulnerable instances when the response is 200 OK with `application/json` content type and the body contains both 'sensei_message' and 'guid":{"rendered":'.
