## Vulnerability
WordPress Plugin WP Statistics <= 13.1.5 is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient escaping and parameterization of the `current_page_type` parameter in `~/includes/class-wp-statistics-hits.php`. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries to obtain sensitive information.

**Impact:** Unauthenticated attackers can exploit time-based blind SQL injection to extract sensitive database contents including user credentials and statistics data.

**CVSS:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5)  
**CWE:** CWE-89

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET to `/` and extracts the `_wpnonce` value via regex from the response body (internal extractor). It then sends a second GET request to `/wp-json/wp-statistics/v2/hit` (with extracted nonce) containing the payload `current_page_type=home'-sleep(6)-'`. Matchers confirm exploitation if response duration >= 6 seconds, status_code == 200, Content-Type contains `application/json`, and body contains `Visitor Hit was recorded successfully`.
