## Vulnerability

WordPress Panda Pods Repeater Field plugin versions prior to 1.5.4 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page response. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker against users who have at least Contributor-level permissions in WordPress. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser context, potentially leading to theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, or other malicious actions performed under the victim's privileges.

The CVSS v3.1 score is 5.4 (Medium), with the vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation with low attack complexity, requiring low privileges and user interaction, with changed scope and low confidentiality and integrity impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template performs authenticated detection of this XSS vulnerability through a two-step process:

1. **Authentication**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with WordPress credentials to establish an authenticated session
2. **XSS Probe**: Sends a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/panda-pods-repeater-field/fields/pandarepeaterfield.php` with a crafted payload in the URL parameters: `itemid=1&podid=1);%20alert(document.domain);/*x&iframe_id=panda-repeater-add-new&success=1`

The template verifies the vulnerability by checking that:
- The response returns HTTP 200 status
- The response body contains the reflected XSS payload `alert(document.domain)`
- The response body contains the expected element identifier `panda-repeater-add-new`

The presence of the unescaped JavaScript payload in the response confirms that user-supplied input is reflected without proper sanitization, making the application vulnerable to XSS attacks.
