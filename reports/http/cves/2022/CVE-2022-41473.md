## Vulnerability
RPCMS 3.0.2 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Search function. An attacker can inject arbitrary script via the `q` parameter in `/search/?q=`, which is reflected unsanitized into the HTML response. This executes in the context of an unsuspecting user's browser (CWE-79; CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, score 6.1). Successful exploitation enables stealing cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, data theft, or website defacement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/search/?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` and verifies the vulnerability if the response body contains the exact unsanitized payload string together with `rpcms`, returns HTTP 200, and sets Content-Type to `text/html`. This confirms lack of output encoding/sanitization on the search results page.
