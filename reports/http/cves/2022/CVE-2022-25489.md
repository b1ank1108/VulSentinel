## Vulnerability
Atom CMS v2.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the `a` parameter in the `/widgets/debug.php` endpoint. User-supplied input is reflected unsanitized in the response body.

Exploitation allows injection of malicious JavaScript, which executes in the context of authenticated users viewing the crafted URL. This can lead to data theft, session hijacking, or page defacement. Fixed in v2.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/widgets/debug.php?a=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and matches on:
- Unsanitized payload reflection in the response body
- Debug page strings ("Path Array", "console-debug")
- text/html Content-Type
- 200 status code

This verifies lack of input sanitization enabling reflected XSS.
