## Vulnerability

WordPress RSS Aggregator plugin versions prior to 4.20 contain an authenticated reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The flaw exists in the `wprss_fetch_items_row_action` AJAX action handler, which fails to properly sanitize and escape the `id` parameter before including it in the HTTP response. This allows an authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the context of a victim's browser session when they are tricked into accessing a malicious URL or submitting a crafted request.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating medium severity with requirements for user interaction and potential for cross-site attack scope.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs authenticated detection of the XSS vulnerability through a two-step process:

1. **Authentication**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with WordPress credentials to establish an authenticated session
2. **XSS Probe**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=wprss_fetch_items_row_action` with a crafted payload in the `id` parameter: `<html><img src onerror=alert(\`document.domain\`)>`

The template verifies the vulnerability by checking for:
- The reflected XSS payload `<img src onerror=alert(\`document.domain\`)>` in the response body
- Content-Type header containing `text/html`
- HTTP 200 status code

This confirms that the unsanitized input is reflected back in the HTML response, demonstrating the exploitable XSS condition.
