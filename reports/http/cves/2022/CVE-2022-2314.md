## Vulnerability
WordPress VR Calendar plugin through version 2.3.2 is susceptible to remote code execution. The plugin allows any user to execute arbitrary PHP functions on the site. An attacker can execute malware, obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or gain full control over a compromised system without entering necessary credentials.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected WordPress site.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8)

Update the WordPress VR Calendar plugin to version 2.3.3 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs two raw GET requests. The first fetches `/wp-content/plugins/vr-calendar-sync/assets/js/public.js` and confirms the plugin via the presence of the string "vrc-calendar". The second targets `/wp-admin/admin-post.php?vrc_cmd=phpinfo` and verifies successful arbitrary PHP function execution by matching both "phpinfo" and "PHP Version" in the response body (along with HTTP 200 on both requests).
