## Vulnerability
Helmet Store Showroom v1.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability on the login page (`/classes/Login.php?f=login`). Unauthenticated remote attackers can inject payloads into the `username` parameter to bypass authentication and gain administrative access. Successful exploitation enables extraction of arbitrary data from the backend database (CVSS 3.1 score 9.8, CWE-89). Remediation requires upgrading to a patched release.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass
The template performs a two-step detection: first a POST to `/classes/Login.php?f=login` using the crafted payload `username='+OR+1%3D1+--+-&password=1234` (no valid credentials required), then a GET to `/admin/`. Success is confirmed when `status_code_2 == 200` and the response body contains both `"Helmet Store"` and `"Adminstrator Admin"`, proving the login bypass succeeded and the admin dashboard is reachable.
