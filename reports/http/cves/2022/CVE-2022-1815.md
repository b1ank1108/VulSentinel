## Vulnerability
Drawio before 18.1.2 is susceptible to server-side request forgery via the /service endpoint in jgraph/drawio. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in unauthorized access to sensitive internal resources or services.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a raw GET request to `/service/0/test.oast.me` (using an interactsh OOB domain) and checks whether the response body contains the string 'Interactsh Server' while the status code equals 200.
