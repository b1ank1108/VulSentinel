affected_product: Spring Cloud Function

preconditions: routing functionality in use
poc_classification: rce

## Vulnerability
Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2 and older unsupported versions are susceptible to remote code execution. When using routing functionality it is possible for a user to provide a specially crafted SpEL as a routing-expression that may result in remote code execution and access to local resources. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends a single POST request to `/functionRouter` with header `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression: T(java.net.InetAddress).getByName("{{interactsh-url}}")` and random form-urlencoded body. Detection succeeds if an out-of-band interaction occurs (interactsh_protocol http or dns) combined with HTTP 500 status, confirming SpEL evaluation and RCE potential.
