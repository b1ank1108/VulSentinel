## Vulnerability
WordPress RSVP and Event Management plugin <2.7.8 contains a missing-authorization vulnerability (CWE-862). The export-entries function is hooked directly to the `init` action with zero permission or capability checks. Unauthenticated remote attackers can therefore retrieve the full RSVP list containing first name, last name, and email address of every user registered for events. The same missing-authorization root cause may also permit broader unauthorized event CRUD actions (create/modify/delete).

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3, medium).  
CPE: cpe:2.3:a:wpchill:rsvp_and_event_management:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

Template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rsvp-admin-export` and confirms exploitation by matching both `'RSVP Status'` and `'"First Name"'` strings in the response
