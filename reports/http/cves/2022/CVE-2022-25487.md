## Vulnerability
Atom CMS v2.0 contains an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability (CWE-434) via the file upload handler at `/admin/uploads.php`. An attacker can submit a multipart/form-data POST request containing a PHP file (disguised as JPEG) that is stored executable under `/uploads/`, granting full remote arbitrary code execution (CVSS 3.1 9.8). Impact includes complete system compromise. Fixed in Atom CMS v2.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template performs active exploitation detection in two HTTP requests. First, it POSTs to `/admin/uploads.php?id=1` a multipart payload with a file named `{{randstr}}.php` containing the one-line PHP webshell `<?php echo md5("CVE-2022-25487");unlink(__FILE__);?>`. Second, it issues a GET to `/uploads/{{filename}}` (filename extracted internally via regex `SET avatar = '(.*?)'` from the upload response) and matches the MD5 hash string in the response body to confirm successful execution and self-deletion.
