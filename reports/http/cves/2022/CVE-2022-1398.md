## Vulnerability
WordPress External Media without Import plugin through version 1.1.2 is vulnerable to authenticated blind server-side request forgery (SSRF, CVE-2022-1398, CWE-918). 

The flaw arises from absent authorization checks and no enforcement that added media URLs are external. Any authenticated user (including subscribers) can therefore force the server to issue arbitrary requests. 

Impact: network restriction bypass, internal resource access, sensitive information disclosure, data modification, or unauthorized administrative actions. CVSS 3.1: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template logs in via POST /wp-login.php using supplied username/password, issues GET /wp-admin/upload.php, then POSTs to /wp-admin/admin-post.php with `action=add_external_media_without_import` and `urls=http://{{interactsh-url}}`. Detection triggers on HTTP callback to interactsh plus presence of "external-media-without-import" in the upload-page response body (confirming plugin context).
