## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-32430 is an access control vulnerability in Lin CMS Spring Boot v0.2.1 caused by a hardcoded default JWT token. The application ships with a predictable JWT secret key that allows attackers to forge valid authentication tokens without any credentials. This enables unauthenticated attackers to access backend administrative information and functions, including user management and content administration capabilities. The vulnerability stems from poor secret management practices where the JWT signing key is either hardcoded or uses a default value that is not changed during deployment.

The impact is severe as attackers can gain complete control over the Lin CMS Spring Boot application by simply using the known default JWT token to authenticate API requests. This bypasses all authentication mechanisms and grants administrative access to sensitive backend operations.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects this vulnerability by attempting to access an administrative endpoint (`/cms/admin/group/all`) that should require authentication. It sends a GET request with a hardcoded JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZGVudGl0eSI6MSwic2NvcGUiOiJsaW4iLCJ0eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNzUzMTkzNDc5fQ.SesmAnYN5QaHqSqllCInH0kvsMya5vHA1qPHuwCZ8N8
```

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking for:
1. A successful HTTP 200 response
2. JSON content type in the response headers
3. Presence of group data fields (`"id":`, `"name":`, `"level":`) in the response body
4. Absence of HTML content (to avoid false positives from error pages)

If these conditions are met, the default JWT token successfully authenticated the request and retrieved administrative group information, confirming the authentication bypass vulnerability.
