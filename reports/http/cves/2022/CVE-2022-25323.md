## Vulnerability
ZEROF Web Server 2.0 suffers from a reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability on the `/admin.back` endpoint, where user input from the URL path is reflected unsanitized in the response body.

The vulnerability has CVSS:3.1 score of 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) and is classified as CWE-79.

Impact includes execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser, enabling session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information. Remediation involves applying vendor security patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The detection template issues a GET request embedding the payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>` (URL-encoded) into the path `/admin.back[payload]`. It verifies exploitation conditions by checking for verbatim reflection of the payload in the body, `text/html` in the Content-Type header, and HTTP 401 status code. This pattern reveals reflected XSS due to missing output encoding on the error/admin path.
