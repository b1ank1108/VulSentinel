## Vulnerability

WordPress plugin **Sassy Social Share** (developed by Heateor) contains a **reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)** vulnerability via the `urls` parameter in the `heateor_sss_sharing_count` AJAX action. The flaw stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the context of the WordPress site when a victim (typically an authenticated user) visits a crafted link or performs a specific action.

Impact includes session theft, account takeover, or performing privileged actions on behalf of logged-in users who are tricked into triggering the payload. The vulnerability is exploitable over the network without authentication to the target site for payload delivery, but successful exploitation typically requires a logged-in victim user to load the malicious request (reflected XSS with social engineering).

CVSS:3.1 score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs a **two-step detection sequence**:

1. Sends a **POST request** to `/wp-login.php` with provided `{{username}}` and `{{password}}` credentials to establish an authenticated session (cookie-based).
2. Sends a **GET request** to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=heateor_sss_sharing_count` with a reflected XSS payload embedded in the `urls` array parameter:  
   `urls[<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>]=`

The matcher checks whether the response body contains **both**:
- the injected payload string literally echoed back (`<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`)
- the expected JSON-like structure fragment (`facebook_urls":`)

together with HTTP 200 status and `text/html` content-type.

This confirms that user-controlled input reaches the response without proper HTML escaping → reflected XSS condition exists. The template itself does **not** execute JavaScript; it only verifies reflection of the harmless probe payload.
