## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-34267 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in RWS WorldServer versions prior to 11.7.3. The vulnerability allows attackers to completely bypass all authentication requirements by simply adding a token parameter with the hardcoded value of "02" to API requests. This authentication bypass can be chained with arbitrary Java code execution capabilities - attackers can upload and execute malicious .jar archives through the ws-api/v2/customizations/api endpoint without any authentication. The flaw stems from improper authentication token validation (CWE-287), enabling unauthenticated remote attackers to gain full system access to the translation management platform, potentially compromising sensitive multilingual content and the entire WorldServer infrastructure. The CVSS score of 9.8 reflects the severity of complete authentication bypass combined with remote code execution capabilities requiring no user interaction or privileges.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects this authentication bypass vulnerability by sending a GET request to the `/ws-api/v2/users/me/details` endpoint with the malicious token parameter set to "02" (`?token=02`). The request requires no authentication headers or credentials. The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for three conditions: (1) the response body contains the string `"fullName":"System"`, indicating the request was authenticated as the System user, (2) the content type is `application/json`, and (3) the HTTP status code is 200. The presence of System user details in the response confirms that the hardcoded token value successfully bypassed all authentication mechanisms and granted privileged access to user information.
