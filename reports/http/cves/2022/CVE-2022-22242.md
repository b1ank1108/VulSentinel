## Vulnerability
Juniper Web Device Manager (J-Web) in Junos OS contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2022-22242, CWE-79). The SERVER_NAME parameter in error.php reflects unsanitized user input, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to inject malicious JavaScript payloads. When a victim with an active J-Web session visits the crafted URL, the script executes in their browser in the context of that session.

This can enable theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, page defacement, or other client-side attacks.  
**CVSS 3.1:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1)  
**Impact:** Arbitrary script execution in the targeted user's browser context.  
**Remediation:** Apply the latest security patches or updates provided by Juniper Networks.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/error.php?SERVER_NAME=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies the vulnerability if the response body simultaneously contains the exact injected script tag and the string "The requested resource is not authorized to view", the Content-Type header contains "text/html", and the status code is 200. This confirms lack of output encoding on the reflected parameter.
