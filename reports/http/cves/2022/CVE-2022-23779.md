## Vulnerability

Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central before 10.1.2137.8 exposes the installed internal server hostname to any unauthenticated user via HTTP redirect responses from the `/themes` endpoint.

This information disclosure enables attackers to perform reconnaissance on the internal network, identify the server name for targeted attacks or lateral movement.

CVSS:3.1 5.3 - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (CWE-200)

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/themes` and confirms the issue if:
- Response status is 301
- Location header matches regex `https?:\/\/(.*):` and does not contain the external `{{Host}}`
- Body contains `<center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>`
- Headers contain both `/themes/` and `text/html`

The internal hostname is extracted via regex from the Location header.
