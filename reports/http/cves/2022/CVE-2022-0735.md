## Vulnerability
GitLab CE/EE is vulnerable to information disclosure (CVE-2022-0735). An unauthenticated attacker can access runner registration tokens using quick actions commands, enabling retrieval of sensitive information, data modification, and/or unauthorized operations. Impact: attacker gains access to sensitive information stored in GitLab.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-863.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/users/sign_in` (following up to 3 redirects). It uses word matchers (OR condition) to detect any of 60+ specific 64-character hashes in the response body, which represent leaked runner registration tokens present in vulnerable versions. It additionally extracts the 64-character application CSS hash via regex `(?:application-)(\S{64})(?:\.css)`.
