## Vulnerability
The Profile Builder User Profile & User Registration Forms WordPress plugin is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting due to insufficient escaping and sanitization of the `site_url` parameter in `assets/misc/fallback-page.php`. Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in the context of the site whenever a user clicks a specially crafted link. Affects versions up to and including 3.6.1 (fixed in 3.6.5).  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1, CWE-79). Impact: data theft, session hijacking, or site defacement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/profile-builder/assets/misc/fallback-page.php?site_url=javascript:alert(document.domain);&message=Not+Found&site_name=404` and verifies the vulnerability by confirming the unsanitized JavaScript payload appears reflected inside an `<a href="...">` tag in the response body, alongside HTTP 200 status and `text/html` content-type header.
