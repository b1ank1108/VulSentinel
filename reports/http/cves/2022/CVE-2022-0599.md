## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-0599 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WordPress Mapping Multiple URLs Redirect Same Page plugin version 5.8 and prior. The vulnerability exists in an admin page where the `mmursp_id` parameter is not properly sanitized or escaped before being output back to the user. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the context of an authenticated administrator's browser session.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). The attack vector is network-based with low attack complexity, requires no privileges but does require user interaction, and has a changed scope with low impact to confidentiality and integrity.

Successful exploitation could lead to session hijacking, website defacement, or theft of sensitive information from authenticated administrative users who are tricked into clicking a malicious link.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs an authenticated detection of the XSS vulnerability through a two-step process:

1. **Authentication**: Sends a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with WordPress credentials to establish an authenticated session.

2. **XSS Probe**: Sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mmursp-list&view=edit` with a crafted `mmursp_id` parameter containing an XSS payload: `"><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`.

The template verifies the vulnerability by checking:
- The response returns HTTP 200 status
- The response Content-Type header contains "text/html"
- The response body contains the reflected payload in an input field: `id="mmursp_id" value="\"><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>" />`

The presence of the unsanitized payload in the HTML output confirms that the parameter is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.
