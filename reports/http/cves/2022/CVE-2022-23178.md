## Vulnerability
An issue was discovered on Crestron HD-MD4X2-4K-E 1.0.0.2159 devices. When the administrative web interface of the HDMI switcher is accessed unauthenticated, user credentials are disclosed that are valid to authenticate to the web interface. Specifically, aj.html sends a JSON document with uname and upassword fields.  
An attacker can obtain sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access and potential compromise of the device.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8) | CWE-287

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues an unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/aj.html?a=devi` and matches for HTTP status 200 combined with the presence of both `"uname":` and `"upassword":` strings in the JSON response body.
