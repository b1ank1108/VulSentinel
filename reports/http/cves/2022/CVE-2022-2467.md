## Vulnerability
Garage Management System 1.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability in `/login.php` via manipulation of the `username` argument. An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially obtaining sensitive information from the database, modifying data, and/or performing unauthorized administrative operations.

**CVSS v3.1**: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE**: CWE-89

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends one POST request to `/login.php` (with `@timeout: 15s`) containing the time-based blind SQLi payload in the `username` field (`1@a.com' AND (SELECT 6427 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(7)))LwLu) AND 'hsvT'='hsvT`) plus dummy `password` and `login` values. It detects the issue when response duration is >=7 seconds, status is 200, and body contains the string "Garage Billing Software".
