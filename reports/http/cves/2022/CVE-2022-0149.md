## Vulnerability
WooCommerce Stored Exporter WordPress Plugin prior to 2.7.1 is affected by reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the `woo_ce` admin page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=woo_ce`) via the `message` (and `failed`) query parameter. User-controlled input is reflected without sanitization or encoding.

CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
CWE: CWE-79  

The plugin was affected by a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the woo_ce admin page. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

Update to version 2.7.1 or apply the vendor-provided patch.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` using supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials, then issues a GET request to the vulnerable admin endpoint embedding the payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the `message` parameter. Detection succeeds if this exact string appears unescaped in the response body, the Content-Type header contains `text/html`, and the status is 200.
