## Vulnerability

SolarView Compact version 6.00 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `time_begin` parameter of the Solar_History.php endpoint. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user input before reflecting it in the HTTP response, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. When a victim accesses a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `time_begin` parameter, the script executes in the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, defacement, or other malicious actions performed with the victim's privileges.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this XSS vulnerability by sending a GET request to `/Solar_History.php` with a crafted `time_begin` parameter containing an XSS payload: `xx"><script>alert(document.domain)</script><"`. The detection verifies the vulnerability by checking for three conditions:

1. The injected payload `<script>alert(document.domain)</script><"">` is reflected in the response body
2. The response contains the string `/Solar_History.php" METHOD="post">`, confirming the correct page context
3. The response has a `text/html` content type and returns HTTP status 200

The template uses a harmless `alert(document.domain)` payload to verify the XSS condition without causing actual harm during scanning.
