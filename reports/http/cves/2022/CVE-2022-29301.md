## Vulnerability

SolarView Compact version 6.00 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `pow` parameter of the `Solar_SlideSub.php` endpoint. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it in the HTTP response, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. When a victim accesses a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `pow` parameter, the script executes in the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, defacement, or other malicious actions performed with the victim's privileges.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this XSS vulnerability by sending a GET request to `/Solar_SlideSub.php` with a crafted `pow` parameter containing a JavaScript payload: `sds"><script>alert(document.domain)</script><"`. The detection verifies:

1. The injected script tag `<script>alert(document.domain)</script><"">` is reflected in the response body
2. The string "SolarView" appears in the response, confirming the target application
3. The response Content-Type header is `text/html`
4. The server returns a 200 OK status code

The template uses a harmless `alert(document.domain)` payload to verify the XSS condition without causing actual harm, demonstrating that arbitrary JavaScript can be executed in the victim's browser context.
