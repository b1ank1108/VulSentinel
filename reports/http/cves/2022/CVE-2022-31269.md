## Vulnerability
Linear eMerge E3-Series access control devices expose administrator credentials in plaintext at the `/test.txt` endpoint when default admin credentials have been changed. An unauthenticated remote attacker can retrieve the admin username and password, then access the admin dashboard to control building access points, cameras, and employee records. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N (score 8.2); CWE-798 (use of hard-coded credentials).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/test.txt` and matches on:
- response body containing both `ID=` and `Password=` (AND condition),
- `Content-Type: text/plain` header,
- HTTP 200 status.
It extracts the password value with the regex `Password='(.+?)'`.
