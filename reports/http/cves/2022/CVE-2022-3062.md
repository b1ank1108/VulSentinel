## Vulnerability
Simple File List WordPress plugin versions prior to 4.4.12 fails to escape user-controlled parameters before outputting them in HTML attributes on the admin settings page, resulting in reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

An authenticated attacker can trick an administrator into visiting a maliciously crafted URL, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser. This may result in session hijacking, defacement, or sensitive data theft.
