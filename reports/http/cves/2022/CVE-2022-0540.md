## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-0540 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Atlassian Jira Seraph. The flaw allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms by sending a specially crafted HTTP request. This affects multiple product lines:

- **Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center**: versions before 8.13.18, versions 8.14.0 through 8.20.5, and versions 8.21.0 through 8.21.x (before 8.22.0)
- **Atlassian Jira Service Management Server and Data Center**: versions before 4.13.18, versions 4.14.0 through 4.20.5, and versions 4.21.0 through 4.21.x (before 4.22.0)

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) with a CVSS score of 9.8. Successful exploitation enables unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of data, and potential disruption of business operations. The EPSS score of 0.92485 (99.725th percentile) indicates a very high probability of active exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

**Classification: auth-bypass**

The template detects this authentication bypass vulnerability by attempting to access administrative endpoints that should require authentication. It sends GET requests to two protected administrative paths:

1. `/InsightPluginShowGeneralConfiguration.jspa;` - Insight plugin configuration page
2. `/secure/WBSGanttManageScheduleJobAction.jspa;` - WBS Gantt schedule job management page

Both paths use a semicolon (`;`) path parameter technique to bypass authentication checks in the Seraph authentication framework. The template confirms successful exploitation by:

- Checking for HTTP 200 status code (indicating successful access)
- Verifying the presence of "General Insight Configuration" text in the response body

The detection stops at the first successful match, indicating that access to either administrative endpoint confirms the vulnerability. No authentication credentials are sent in the requests, demonstrating that the bypass allows completely unauthenticated access to protected resources.
