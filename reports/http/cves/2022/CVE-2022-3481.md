## Vulnerability
NotificationX Dropshipping WordPress plugin versions prior to 4.4 is vulnerable to unauthenticated time-based blind SQL injection. The plugin fails to sanitise and escape a user-supplied parameter before using it in a SQL statement via the publicly accessible REST endpoint `/wp-json/woo-aliexpress/v1/product-sku`. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this to extract sensitive WooCommerce data including customer information, order details, and payment records.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single POST request containing the time-based blind SQL injection payload `{"sku":"a\" AND (SELECT 42 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(7)))wlHd)-- pOeU"}` to `/wp-json/woo-aliexpress/v1/product-sku`. Vulnerability is confirmed when the server response satisfies all of: response duration ≥ 7 seconds, HTTP status 200, `Content-Type` containing `application/json`, and body containing the strings `code\":`, `message\":\"Product`, and `status\":400`.
