## Vulnerability
SearchWP Live Ajax Search WordPress plugin < 1.6.2 allows unauthenticated arbitrary post title disclosure. The plugin does not restrict live search results to published posts, enabling unauthenticated attackers to craft queries with manipulated `post_status` parameters (e.g., `draft`, `private`, `pending`) and retrieve titles plus permalinks of non-public posts. CVSS 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). Fixed in 1.6.2.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends two unauthenticated GET requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=searchwp_live_search&swpquery=a` (first with `post_status=publish`, second with `post_status=draft`). It matches on both returning HTTP 200, `text/html` Content-Type, presence of the string `searchwp-live-search-result` in body, and differing body lengths between the two responses, confirming the plugin leaks non-published post data.
