## Vulnerability
MCMS 5.2.5 contains a SQL injection vulnerability via the `categoryId` parameter in the file `IContentDao.xml` at the POST `/cms/content/list` endpoint. An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially obtaining sensitive information, modifying data, and/or performing unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-89. CPE: cpe:2.3:a:mingsoft:mcms:5.2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/cms/content/list` with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and payload `categoryId=1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,md5(999999999),0x7e),1) and 'zzz'='zzz`. It matches the presence of the string `c8c605999f3d8352d7bb792cf3fdb25` (md5(999999999)) anywhere in the response body to confirm the error-based injection succeeds and unauthorized data can be read.
