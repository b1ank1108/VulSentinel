## Vulnerability

An unauthenticated SQL injection (CVE-2022-24627, CWE-89) exists in AudioCodes Device Manager Express through 7.8.20002.47752. The flaw lies in the `p` parameter of the `/admin/AudioCodes_files/process_login.php` login form.

Unauthenticated remote attackers can bypass authentication, extract sensitive VoIP configuration data, and potentially obtain administrative access.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8).

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template first issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` and internally matches `contains(tolower(body), "audiocodes</title>")` to fingerprint the product. It then sends a raw POST request to `/admin/AudioCodes_files/process_login.php` with form data `username=admin&password=&domain=&p=%5C%27or+1%3D1%23` and matches on MySQL error strings ("SQL syntax", "mysql_fetch", "You have an error in your SQL syntax") in the response body to confirm the injection point.
