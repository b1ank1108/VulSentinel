## Vulnerability
WordPress ProfileGrid plugin prior to 5.1.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `id` GET parameter on the `pm_add_group` admin page before outputting it back in the HTML response. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the context of an authenticated victim's browser on the affected site, enabling theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, or defacement.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1) · CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template first performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` using supplied `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials. It then sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=pm_add_group&id="><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and verifies success via DSL matchers confirming HTTP 200, HTML content-type, presence of page marker "Extension Options", and reflection of the unsanitized `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` payload in the response body.
