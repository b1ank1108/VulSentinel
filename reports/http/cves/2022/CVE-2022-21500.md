## Vulnerability

Oracle E-Business Suite versions 12.1 and 12.2 contain an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Manage Proxies component. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise the application by exploiting self-registration functionality. This is an easily exploitable flaw that requires no authentication or user interaction.

Successful exploitation enables unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle E-Business Suite accessible data. The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 (High severity) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation with low complexity, no privileges required, and high confidentiality impact.

The EPSS score of 0.93892 (99.869th percentile) indicates this vulnerability has an extremely high probability of exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The template detects this vulnerability by attempting to access self-registration pages that should require authentication or be restricted. It sends GET requests to four different registration endpoints:

1. `/OA_HTML/ibeCAcpSSOReg.jsp` - SSO registration page
2. `/OA_HTML/ibeCRgpPrimaryCreate.jsp` - Primary account creation page
3. `/OA_HTML/ibeCRgpIndividualUser.jsp` - Individual user registration page
4. `/OA_HTML/ibeCRgpPartnerPriCreate.jsp` - Partner primary creation page

The template uses a stop-at-first-match strategy, checking each endpoint sequentially. A vulnerable instance is identified when:
- The response returns HTTP 200 status
- The response contains registration-related content including the words "Registration", "Register as individual", and the Oracle E-Business Suite runtime include comment `<!-- ibeCZzpRuntimeIncl.jsp end -->`

The presence of accessible self-registration pages without authentication indicates the authentication bypass vulnerability exists, allowing attackers to create unauthorized accounts and gain access to the system.
