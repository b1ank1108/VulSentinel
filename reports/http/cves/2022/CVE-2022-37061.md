## Vulnerability
FLIR AX8 version 1.46.16 and below is susceptible to a remote command injection vulnerability. The vulnerability exists in the alarm functionality where user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.

Impact: Authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands on FLIR AX8 thermal imaging cameras through command injection in the alarm functionality's id parameter, potentially gaining complete control over the camera system and connected infrastructure.

Remediation: Upgrade to the latest version of FLIR AX8 that addresses this vulnerability. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-78.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first issues POST /login/dologin with `user_name={{username}}&user_password={{password}}` to authenticate, then POST /res.php with `action=alarm&id=2;id` to inject and run the `id` command. It verifies success by matching the second response body (AND condition) for regex `uid=([0-9(a-z)]+)`, `gid=([0-9(a-z)]+)`, `visualBeep` plus HTTP status 200.
