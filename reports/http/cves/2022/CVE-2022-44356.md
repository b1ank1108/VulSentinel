## Vulnerability

WAVLINK Quantum D4G (WL-WN531G3) router running firmware versions M31G3.V5030.201204 and M31G3.V5030.200325 contains an access control vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to download sensitive configuration data and log files. The vulnerability stems from improper access controls on administrative endpoints, specifically the `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` script, which can be accessed without authentication. This exposure allows attackers to retrieve credentials (login and password), WiFi configuration details, and other sensitive system information stored in log and configuration files. The CVSS score of 7.5 (High) reflects the significant confidentiality impact, with the vulnerability being exploitable remotely without authentication or user interaction.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-stage detection process:

1. **Initial fingerprinting**: Sends a GET request to the base URL to verify the target is a WAVLINK WN531G3 device by checking for the presence of "WN531G3" in the response body.

2. **Vulnerability verification**: Sends a GET request to `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` and validates the vulnerability by checking for:
   - Response body containing sensitive configuration markers: "Login=", "Password=", "WiFi_", and "WAVLINK"
   - Response headers indicating file download: "application/octet-stream" content type and "filename=" header
   - HTTP 200 status code

The template confirms the vulnerability when all conditions are met, indicating that configuration and log files containing credentials and WiFi settings are accessible without authentication.
