## Vulnerability
ILIAS eLearning before 7.16 contains an open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601) exploitable via the `return` parameter in `shib_logout.php` (and `/ilias/shib_logout.php`). An unauthenticated attacker can supply an arbitrary URL, causing the application to redirect users to a malicious site. This can lead to phishing attacks, credential theft, or bypass of URL-based controls. The flaw does not require any special configuration beyond a vulnerable installation.

**Impact**  
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites, leading to phishing attacks. The vulnerability may also allow obtaining sensitive information, modifying data, and/or executing unauthorized operations.

**Remediation**  
Upgrade to ILIAS eLearning version 7.16 or later.

**CVSS 3.1**  
6.1 (Medium) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template performs a GET request to either `{{BaseURL}}/shib_logout.php?action=logout&return=https://oast.me` or `{{BaseURL}}/ilias/shib_logout.php?action=logout&return=https://oast.me` (stopping at the first match). It matches on a regex in the `Location` response header that confirms reflection of the attacker-controlled `oast.me` domain. No payload is executed and no server-side state is altered; the check simply verifies that the `return` value is used unsanitized in the redirect.
