## Vulnerability
WordPress Order Listener for WooCommerce (woc-order-alert) plugin before version 3.2.2 is affected by an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability. The `id` parameter in the REST route `/?rest_route=/olistener/new` is not sanitized or escaped before being used in a SQL statement. An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries to obtain sensitive information, modify data, or perform unauthorized administrative operations.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template verifies the vulnerability using a time-based blind SQL injection probe. It sends a POST request to `/?rest_route=/olistener/new` with JSON payload `{"id":" (SLEEP(6))#"}` and measures response time. A follow-up GET request fetches `/wp-content/plugins/woc-order-alert/assets/admin/js/scripts.js` to confirm plugin presence. The combined matcher passes if the first request duration is >=6 seconds, returns HTTP 200 with `application/json` content-type, and the second response body contains the string `olistener-action.olistener-controller`.
