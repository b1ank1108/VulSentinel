## Vulnerability
MotionEye v0.42.1 and below allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive configuration information via GET /config/list when the regular user password is unconfigured. This exposes upload_password, network_password and other config data, potentially compromising connected camera systems and networks.

Impact: High confidentiality exposure (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, score 7.5, CWE-1188).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the vulnerability by sending a GET request to `/config/list` and verifying the response meets these conditions: status code 200, `application/json` content-type header, and the body containing both `upload_password` and `network_password`.
