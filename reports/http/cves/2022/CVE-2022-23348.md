## Vulnerability
BigAnt Server 5.6.06 is affected by an improper access control vulnerability (CWE-916). The application exposes weak password hashes for administrative accounts in the `ms_admin.php` file, allowing unauthenticated attackers to retrieve them. This can lead to password cracking, sensitive information disclosure, data modification, or unauthorized operations.

CVSS v3.1: 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/Runtime/Data/ms_admin.php` and checks for a successful response (status 200, text/html content-type) containing indicators of administrative user data such as `"user_name";`, `"user_pwd";`, and `"user_id";` in the body.
