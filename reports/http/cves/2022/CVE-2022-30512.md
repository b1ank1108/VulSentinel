## Vulnerability
School Dormitory Management System 1.0 contains a critical SQL injection (CWE-89) vulnerability in `dms/admin/accounts/payment_history.php` via the `account_id` parameter. Unauthenticated remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to sensitive information disclosure, data modification, and unauthorized administrative operations. CVSS 3.1 score 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/dms/admin/accounts/payment_history.php?account_id=2%27` to trigger an SQL syntax error. Detection matches on the response body containing all of: `Fatal error`, `Uncaught Error: Call to a member function fetch_assoc()`, and `<th class="">Month of</th>`, plus `text/html` in the Content-Type header and HTTP 200 status.
