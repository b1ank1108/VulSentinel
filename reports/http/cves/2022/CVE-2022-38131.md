## Vulnerability
RStudio Connect prior to 2023.01.0 is affected by an open redirect vulnerability (CVE-2022-38131, CWE-601). An attacker can craft a URL that causes the server to redirect users to arbitrary malicious websites.

CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).  
Impact: enables phishing attacks or other security breaches by redirecting users.  
Remediation: fixed in Connect v2023.05; for v1.7.2+, mitigable via configuration setting.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template issues one raw HTTP GET request with path `//%5coast.me` against the target hostname and verifies the response contains HTTP/1.1 307 status together with a `Location` header matching the regex for an external redirect to a domain containing `oast.me`.
