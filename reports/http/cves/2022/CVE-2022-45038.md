## Vulnerability
WBCE CMS v1.5.4 contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in `/admin/settings/save.php`. Unsanitized input in the `website_footer` field allows authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (CWE-79). Successful exploitation could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or site defacement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first authenticates to the admin interface by fetching the login page, extracting form field names and tokens via regex, then performs a login POST. It subsequently loads the settings page, submits a POST request to `/admin/settings/save.php` embedding `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the website_footer parameter, and finally GETs `/search/index.php` to confirm the payload is stored and rendered unescaped in the response body (matched with "Results For" and status 200).
