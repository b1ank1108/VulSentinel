## Vulnerability
WordPress Fontsy plugin <=1.8.6 is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL injection in the `get_tag_fonts` AJAX action. The `id` parameter is not sanitized before use in SQL queries, allowing arbitrary SQL execution. This can lead to sensitive data extraction, data modification, and unauthorized admin operations on the WordPress installation.

CVSS v3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) | CWE-89

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The detection template performs a UNION-based SQL injection by POSTing to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_tag_fonts` a payload injecting `md5(999999999)` into the query results. Success is confirmed if the MD5 hash string appears in the 200 OK HTML response body.
