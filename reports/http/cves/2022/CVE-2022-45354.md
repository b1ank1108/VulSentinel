## Vulnerability
The Download Monitor WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information exposure via an unauthenticated REST API endpoint. Versions up to and including 4.7.60 allow unauthenticated attackers to extract user reports, download reports, and user data (email, role, ID, and other details — excluding passwords).

CVSS v3.1: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-json/download-monitor/v1/user_data` and verifies exposure by matching for the presence of `"registered":` and `"display_name":` (AND condition) in the JSON body, `application/json` Content-Type header, and HTTP 200 status.
