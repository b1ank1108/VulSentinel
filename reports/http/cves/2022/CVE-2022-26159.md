## Vulnerability
Ametys CMS before 4.5.0 is affected by an information disclosure flaw (CVE-2022-26159, CWE-425) exploitable by remote unauthenticated attackers. The auto-completion plugin endpoint leaks XML documents (e.g. `/plugins/web/service/search/auto-completion/domain/en.xml` and language variants) containing every character typed by every user on the platform, including usernames, email addresses, passwords, and full content of private pages.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (5.3). Impact includes exposure of sensitive user data and internal search history.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/plugins/web/service/search/auto-completion/domain/en.xml?q=adm` and confirms the leak by matching the presence of both `<auto-completion>` and `<item>` strings in the response body, a `text/xml` Content-Type header, and HTTP 200 status.
