## Vulnerability
An issue was discovered in Smart Office Web 20.28 and earlier that allows attackers to download sensitive information via the action name parameter to ExportEmployeeDetails.aspx and ExportReportingManager.aspx. Unauthenticated attackers can download sensitive employee information including personal details, employee codes, and reporting relationships through vulnerable export endpoints, potentially exposing confidential HR data.

CVSS v3.1: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Remediation: Upgrade to a version later than 20.28 that implements proper authentication checks on export endpoints.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/ExportReportingManager.aspx` and matches on status_code == 200, content_type containing "application/CSV", and body containing both "EmployeeName" and "EmployeeCode" to confirm exposure of employee data in CSV format.
