## Vulnerability
WordPress Gwyn's Imagemap Selector plugin <=0.3.3 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize the `id` and `class` parameters before returning them in HTML attributes in `popup.php`.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context, enabling session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs GET requests to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/gwyns-imagemap-selector/popup.php` injecting the payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` into the `id` and `class` parameters (two variants: one prefixed with `id=1&class=`, the other with `id=1"`). Detection matches the unsanitized payload string in the response body (followed by ` popup-`), `text/html` content-type in headers, and HTTP 200 status. Uses `stop-at-first-match: true`.
