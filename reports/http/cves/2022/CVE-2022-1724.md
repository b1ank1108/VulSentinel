## Vulnerability

WordPress Simple Membership plugin before 4.1.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape parameters before outputting them back in AJAX actions (specifically the `fieldId` parameter passed to the `swpm_validate_email` action).

**CVSS:** 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
**CWE:** CWE-79  

**Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the affected website.  

**Remediation:** Update to version 4.1.1 or higher.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template executes two sequential requests. The first retrieves `/wp-content/plugins/simple-membership/readme.txt` and internally matches for the words 'Simple Membership' and 'Tags:' to confirm plugin presence. The second issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=swpm_validate_email&fieldId=%22%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E` and matches for the exact unsanitized payload string in the JSON response body, `text/html` content-type header, and HTTP 200 status code.
