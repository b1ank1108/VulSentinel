## Vulnerability
Hospital Management System 1.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability via the editid parameter in `/HMS/user-login.php`. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information from a database, modify data, and execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site.  

Successful exploitation allows arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation.  

**CVSS v3.1:** 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE:** CWE-89  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to the latest version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  

The template issues a single POST request to `/hms/user-login.php` (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) containing the classic SQL injection payload `admin' or '1'='1#` in both the `username` and `password` fields. It confirms successful exploitation by matching the presence of both `<title>User  | Dashboard</title>` and `Book My Appointment` strings in the response body together with HTTP 200 status (with host-redirects enabled).
