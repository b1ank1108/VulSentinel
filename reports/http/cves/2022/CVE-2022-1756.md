template_path: nuclei-templates/http/cves/2022/CVE-2022-1756.yaml
affected_product: Newsletter WordPress plugin
severity: medium
authentication: required
external_callback: false
affected_versions: < 7.4.5
preconditions: WordPress installation with Newsletter plugin installed and activated
poc_classification: info-leak

## Vulnerability
The Newsletter WordPress plugin before 7.4.5 does not sanitize and escape the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` before echoing it back in admin pages. Although this uses `addslashes`, and most modern browsers automatically URLEncode requests, this is still vulnerable to Reflected XSS in older browsers such as Internet Explorer 9 or below.  
Impact: Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential data theft or unauthorized actions.  
Remediation: Fixed in version 7.4.5.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs authentication via a POST to `/wp-login.php` using provided `{{username}}`/`{{password}}` credentials. It then issues a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=newsletter_main_index&debug&"><svg/onload=alert(/document.domain/)>` containing the reflected XSS payload. The matcher confirms exploitation conditions if status_code == 200 and the response body contains both the string "newsletter" and the unsanitized payload.
