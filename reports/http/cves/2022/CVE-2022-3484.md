## Vulnerability
WordPress WPB Show Core (wpb-show-core) plugin contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The `fileList[0][title]` parameter in `/wp-content/plugins/wpb-show-core/modules/jplayer_new/jplayer_twitter_ver_1.php` is not sanitized or escaped before output. Attacker-supplied JavaScript executes in the victim's browser context, enabling cookie theft, session hijacking, and further client-side attacks. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access, data theft, and potential full site compromise on affected WordPress installations. Remediation requires updating to the latest plugin version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues one GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/wpb-show-core/modules/jplayer_new/jplayer_twitter_ver_1.php` embedding the payload `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the `fileList[0][title]` query parameter. It confirms the flaw with an AND DSL matcher requiring status_code == 200, text/html content-type, presence of "wpb_jplayer_setting" string, and exact unsanitized reflection of the alert payload in the response body.
