## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-29009 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability affecting Cyber Cafe Management System version 1.0. The vulnerability exists in the Admin panel authentication mechanism, specifically in the username and password parameters of the login form. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication controls through SQL injection, enabling them to gain unauthorized administrative access to the system. Due to improper input validation and sanitization (CWE-89), attackers can manipulate SQL queries to circumvent authentication logic. Successful exploitation enables attackers to obtain sensitive information from the database, modify data, and execute unauthorized administrative operations within the affected application. The CVSS score of 9.8 reflects the severity of this vulnerability, with attack vector being network-based, low attack complexity, no privileges required, and no user interaction needed.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: auth-bypass

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by performing a two-step authentication bypass test:

1. **SQL Injection Authentication Bypass**: Sends a POST request to `/ccms/index.php` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the username parameter (`' Or 1-- -`) and an arbitrary password value. This payload attempts to manipulate the SQL authentication query to always evaluate to true, bypassing the login mechanism.

2. **Access Verification**: Follows up with a GET request to `/ccms/dashboard.php` to verify successful authentication bypass by checking if the admin dashboard is accessible.

The template confirms successful exploitation by matching both:
- The presence of specific strings indicating the admin dashboard ("CCMS Admin Dashboard" and "CCMS ADMIN | Admin") in the response body
- An HTTP 200 status code

This detection method validates that the SQL injection successfully bypassed authentication and granted administrative access to the system.
