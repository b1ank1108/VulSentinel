## Vulnerability
LISTSERV 17 web interface contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML via the "c" parameter in `/scripts/wa.exe` or `/scripts/wa-HAP.exe`, allowing execution in the context of the targeted user's browser.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1) · CWE-79.  
Successful exploitation enables session hijacking (cookie theft), page defacement, or theft of sensitive information.  
Remediation: apply latest vendor security patches.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues GET requests with a harmless reflected-XSS probe (`?TICKET=test&c=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`) to the two endpoint variants, then verifies the exact unsanitized payload appears in the response body (ANDed with "LISTSERV" string), `Content-Type: text/html` header, and HTTP 200 status. `stop-at-first-match: true` aborts after the first positive response.
