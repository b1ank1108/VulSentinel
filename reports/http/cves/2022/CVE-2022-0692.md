## Vulnerability
An open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601) in Rudloff alltube allows an attacker to construct a URL that redirects users to an arbitrary external domain. The flaw is present via Packagist handling in versions prior to 3.0.1.  

**CVSS 3.1:** 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
**Impact:** Enables phishing attacks or malware distribution by redirecting victims to malicious sites.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to version 3.0.1 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only  

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php/interact.sh` and applies a regex matcher on the `Location` response header. A match for any redirect containing `interact.sh` (including protocol-relative or encoded variants) confirms the open redirect is exploitable.
