## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-45269 is a directory traversal vulnerability in the SCS.Web.Server.SPI/1.0 component of Linx Sphere version 7.35.ST15. The vulnerability stems from improper validation of file paths, allowing unauthenticated attackers to traverse the directory structure and read arbitrary files from the server. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive configuration files, credentials, application source code, and other confidential data stored on the system. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 (High severity), indicating network-based exploitation with low attack complexity and no privileges or user interaction required.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request with a path traversal payload to the target server. The request attempts to access `../../../../../../../../../../../../windows/iis.log`, using multiple directory traversal sequences to escape the web root and reach the Windows system directory. The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for two conditions: (1) the HTTP response status is 200 OK, and (2) the response body contains the string "Component Based Setup", which is characteristic content found in Windows IIS log files. This detection method confirms that the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied file paths, allowing attackers to read files outside the intended directory structure.
