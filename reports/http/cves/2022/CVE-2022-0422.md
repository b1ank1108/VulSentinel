## Vulnerability
WordPress White Label CMS plugin before 2.2.9 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. It does not sanitize and validate the `wlcms[_login_custom_js]` parameter before outputting it back in the response while previewing on the `/wp-login.php?wlcms-action=preview` endpoint.

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected website (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, score 6.1), potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information. Remediation requires updating to version 2.2.9 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/wp-login.php?wlcms-action=preview` containing the form-urlencoded payload `wlcms[_login_custom_js]=alert(/XSS/);`. It verifies the vulnerability by confirming the exact payload string is reflected unsanitized in the response body, the page contains the plugin-specific identifier `wlcms-login-wrapper`, the `Content-Type` header includes `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
