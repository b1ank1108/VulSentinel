## Vulnerability
Zimbra Collaboration Suite versions 8.8.15 and 9.0 contain a memcached command injection vulnerability (CVE-2022-27924). An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject arbitrary memcache commands, resulting in cache poisoning that overwrites arbitrary cached entries and enables theft of user credentials in cleartext.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8).  
Impact includes facilitation of spear-phishing, social engineering, business email compromise, or persistent access.  
Remediation: update to 8.8.15 Patch 31 or 9.0.0 Patch 24.1 (or later) and enable multi-factor authentication.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change  
The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/js/zimbraMail/share/model/ZmSettings.js`. Matchers (AND condition) verify:  
- body contains "Zimbra Collaboration Suite Web Client"  
- header contains "application/x-javascript"  
- extracted version (via regex on CLIENT_VERSION in body) contains "8.8.15" or "9.0"  
- status 200.  
This passively fingerprints vulnerable installations via the publicly accessible JavaScript resource containing the version string.
