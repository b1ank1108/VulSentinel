## Vulnerability

WordPress Simply Schedule Appointments plugin versions before 1.5.7.7 contain an information disclosure vulnerability due to missing authorization in a REST API endpoint. The plugin exposes a REST endpoint (`/wp-json/ssa/v1/users`) that lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated attackers to retrieve sensitive user information including names, email addresses, and gravatar URLs. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) with a CVSS score of 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating network-exploitable access with low complexity and no privileges required.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated GET request to the `/wp-json/ssa/v1/users` REST API endpoint. The detection verifies:

1. The response contains a JSON content-type header (`application/json`)
2. The response body includes a successful response code (200) and user data matching the pattern for email addresses, display names, and gravatar URLs
3. The HTTP status code is 200

The template uses regex pattern matching to identify the presence of user information fields in the JSON response, confirming that the endpoint is accessible without authentication and leaking sensitive user data.
