## Vulnerability
WordPress WP Fundraising Donation and Crowdfunding Platform plugin for WordPress (vendor: wpmet) contains an unauthenticated SQL injection (CWE-89) before version 1.5.0. The flaw is in the REST route `/xs-donate-form/payment-redirect/` where the `id` JSON parameter is not sanitized or escaped before use in a SQL statement. 

Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, resulting in sensitive information disclosure, data modification, or unauthorized administrative operations on the WordPress database. CVSS 3.1 score 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `GET /index.php?rest_route=/xs-donate-form/payment-redirect/3` with JSON body `{"id": "(SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(6)))me)", "formid": "1", "type": "online_payment"}` (10s timeout).  

It verifies exploitation by matching all conditions: response duration ≥6s (confirming successful SLEEP), HTTP 200, Content-Type containing "application/json", and body containing "Invalid payment.".
