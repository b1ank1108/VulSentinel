## Vulnerability
MantisBT before 2.25.2 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in browser_search_plugin.php. The application does not properly sanitize the 'type' parameter, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted URL.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1) • CWE-79

Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or phishing attacks.

Remediation: Upgrade to MantisBT 2.25.2 or later. If immediate upgrade is not possible, restrict access to the browser_search_plugin.php endpoint.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/browser_search_plugin.php?type=text%27%22()%26%25<acx><ScRiPt>alert(document.domain)</ScRiPt>` and matches on:
- response body containing both `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` and `<ShortName>`
- `Content-Type: application/opensearchdescription`
- HTTP status 200

This confirms unsanitized reflection of the injected payload inside the returned OpenSearch XML description.
