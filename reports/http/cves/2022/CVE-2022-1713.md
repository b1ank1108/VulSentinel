## Vulnerability
Drawio versions prior to 18.0.4 is affected by a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2022-1713, CWE-918) in the `/proxy` endpoint. An unauthenticated remote attacker can abuse the `?url=` parameter to force the server to issue arbitrary HTTP requests to internal or external resources, resulting in leakage of sensitive internal data.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5).  
Impact: unauthorized access to internal network resources and potential data leakage.  
Remediation: upgrade to 18.0.4 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a raw GET request `GET /proxy?url=http://0:8080/` (with Host header) and matches on two conditions: response body containing `<title>Flowchart Maker & Online Diagram Software</title>` and `Content-Type` header containing `application/octet-stream`. This confirms the SSRF by observing the server successfully proxying and returning content from an internal address.
