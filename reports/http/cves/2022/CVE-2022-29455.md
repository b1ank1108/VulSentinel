## Vulnerability
WordPress Elementor Website Builder plugin versions 3.5.5 and earlier contain a reflected DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Description: The plugin contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability via the document object model.

Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to data theft, session hijacking, or website defacement.

CVSS: 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

CWE: CWE-79

Remediation: Upgrade to version 3.5.6 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only

The template performs version fingerprinting by sending a GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/elementor/readme.txt`. It verifies a 200 status code, the presence of 'Elementor Website Builder' in the body, extracts the 'Stable tag' version via regex, and uses `compare_versions(version, '<= 3.5.5')` to identify affected installations. The template does not trigger the XSS payload.
