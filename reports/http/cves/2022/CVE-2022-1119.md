## Vulnerability
WordPress Simple File List before 3.2.8 is vulnerable to local file inclusion via the eeFile parameter in the ~/includes/ee-downloader.php due to missing controls which make it possible for unauthenticated attackers retrieve arbitrary files.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5)  
CWE-22  
Impact: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to further compromise.  
Remediation: Update WordPress Simple File List to version 3.2.8 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-content/plugins/simple-file-list/includes/ee-downloader.php?eeFile=%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e/wp-config.php` and matches on HTTP 200 status together with the simultaneous presence of the strings `DB_NAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` in the response body.
