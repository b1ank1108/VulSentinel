## Vulnerability
WordPress Easy Student Results plugin through 2.2.8 lacks authorization checks on its REST API endpoints. Unauthenticated remote attackers can retrieve sensitive data including courses, exams, departments, student grades, names, registration numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, and phone numbers.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5 High, CWE-862).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends two unauthenticated raw GET requests:  
`GET /wp-json/rps_result/v1/route/student_fields`  
`GET /wp-json/rps_result/v1/route/search_student?department_id=1&batch_id=1`  

It then matches `departments`/`batches` in the first response body, `meta_data`/`name`/`registration_no` in the second, `application/json` content-type in headers, and HTTP 200 status on both.
