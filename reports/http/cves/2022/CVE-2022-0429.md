## Vulnerability
Unauthenticated stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS, CWE-79) in WP Cerber Security, Anti-spam & Malware Scan WordPress plugin before 8.9.6.  
The plugin fails to sanitise the `$url` variable before outputting it in an HTML attribute on the Activity tab of the plugins dashboard.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).  
Unauthenticated attackers inject XSS payloads via unsanitised URL parameters; payloads execute in the context of any authenticated administrator viewing the Activity tab, enabling session-cookie theft or arbitrary administrative actions on behalf of the victim.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change  
The template injects a stored XSS payload (unauthenticated) then verifies reflection as an authenticated administrator:  
- Step 1 (unauth): `POST /"/onmouseover=alert(document.domain);//` (malformed path + dummy form body) to trigger logging of the unsanitised `$url`; internal matcher confirms 403 + "RID" string.  
- Step 2 (auth): POST to `/wp-login.php` with provided credentials, followed by GET `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cerber-security&tab=activity`; matcher confirms the exact reflected payload string `<wbr>/"<wbr>/onmouseover=alert(document.domain);<wbr>/<wbr>/</p>` in the second response body (status 200).  
This confirms the stored XSS condition that enables unauthorised state changes when the admin views the page.
