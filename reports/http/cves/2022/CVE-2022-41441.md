## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-41441 is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ReQlogic version 11.3. The vulnerability exists in the ProcessWait.aspx page where the POBatch and WaitDuration parameters are not properly sanitized before being reflected in the HTML response. Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code through these parameters, which will be executed in the context of a victim's browser when they visit a malicious link. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). The attack vector is network-based, requires low attack complexity, no privileges, but does require user interaction (the victim must click a malicious link). The scope is changed, meaning the vulnerable component impacts resources beyond its security scope, with low impact to confidentiality and integrity but no impact to availability.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending HTTP GET requests to the ProcessWait.aspx endpoint with XSS payloads injected into the POBatch and WaitDuration parameters. Two test cases are executed:

1. Injecting the payload `</script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` into the POBatch parameter
2. Injecting the same payload into the WaitDuration parameter

The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for:
- HTTP 200 status code response
- Content-Type header containing "text/html"
- The injected script tag `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` reflected in the response body
- Presence of "POProcessTimeout" string in the response, confirming the correct page context

The template uses `stop-at-first-match: true` to halt testing once one vulnerable parameter is confirmed, and follows redirects to ensure proper detection.
