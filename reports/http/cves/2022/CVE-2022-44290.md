## Vulnerability
webTareas 2.4p5 contains a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability via the `id` parameter in `/approvals/deleteapprovalstages.php`. Authenticated attackers can exploit this flaw to extract sensitive database contents including task data, user credentials, and project information.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first authenticates by sending a multipart POST login request to `/general/login.php` using `{{username}}` and `{{password}}`. It follows with a GET request to `/approvals/deleteapprovalstages.php?id=1)+AND+(SELECT+3830+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(6)))MbGE)+AND+(6162=6162` (with 20s timeout). The matcher confirms exploitation if response duration is >= 6 seconds, status_code is 200, Content-Type contains text/html, and body includes 'Delete the following?'.
