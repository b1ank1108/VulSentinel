## Vulnerability
Car Rental Management System 1.0 contains an SQL injection vulnerability via `/booking.php?car_id=`. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information from a database, modify data, and execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or even complete compromise of the system. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 7.2), CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak
The template first issues a POST to `/admin/ajax.php?action=login` (with `username`/`password` variables) to establish an authenticated session, then sends a GET to `/booking.php?car_id=-1%20union%20select%201,md5(999999999),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10--+` and matches the literal MD5 hash string in the 200 OK response body to confirm the union-based injection point.
