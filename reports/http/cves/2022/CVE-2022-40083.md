## Vulnerability
Labstack Echo 4.8.0 contains an open redirect vulnerability via the Static Handler component (CWE-601). An unauthenticated remote attacker can supply a crafted URL that forces a 301 redirect to an arbitrary external domain. The flaw is explicitly described as enabling server-side request forgery that can be leveraged to obtain sensitive information, modify data, or execute unauthorized operations; successful exploitation also supports phishing attacks and credential theft. CVSSv3.1 vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H yields score 9.6. Fixed by upgrading to 4.9.0.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}//interactsh.com%2f..` and confirms the vulnerability when the server responds with HTTP 301 and a Location header matching the regex `^\s*//interactsh.com/\.\.`.
