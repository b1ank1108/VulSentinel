## Vulnerability
Complete Online Job Search System 1.0 is affected by a SQL injection (CWE-89) vulnerability in the `search` parameter of the `/index.php?q=category` endpoint.  

An unauthenticated attacker who first authenticates as an administrator can inject arbitrary SQL via the search value, enabling extraction of sensitive database contents (user credentials, job applications, employer data), data modification, and unauthorized administrative operations.  

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 7.2).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?q=category&search=Banking%27%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,md5(999999999),15,16,17,18,19--+` and checks the response body for the literal string produced by `md5(999999999)` to confirm the injection point allows controlled data exfiltration.
