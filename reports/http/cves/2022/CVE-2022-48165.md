## Vulnerability

Wavlink WL-WN530H4 firmware M30H4.V5030.210121 is affected by improper access control (CWE-284) in the `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` component. Unauthenticated remote attackers can retrieve system log files and configuration data, exposing admin `Login=` and `Password=` credentials and enabling further unauthorized operations.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). Impact includes data leakage and potential device compromise. Remediation: apply the latest firmware update from the vendor.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` and confirms exposure when the response meets all three conditions: HTTP status 200, `filename="sysLogs.txt"` present in the Content-Disposition header, and both `Password=` and `Login=` strings appearing in the body. It also extracts any password value using the regex `Password=([^\s]+)`.
