## Vulnerability
WordPress Title Experiments Free plugin before 9.0.1 is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL injection via the unsanitized `id` parameter in the `wpex_titles` AJAX action on `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`. The flaw occurs because the plugin directly uses the parameter in a SQL statement without sanitization or escaping.  

Successful exploitation allows arbitrary SQL query execution in the context of the WordPress database, enabling sensitive data extraction, data modification, and unauthorized administrative operations. No authentication, specific features, or configuration changes are required beyond the vulnerable plugin version being active.  

CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template sends a single POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=wpex_titles&id[]=1 AND (SELECT 321 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(6)))je)`. It matches on a combination of response time delay (`duration>=6`), HTTP 200 status, `text/html` content-type, and the presence of `{"images":` in the body to confirm the time-based blind SQL injection condition.
