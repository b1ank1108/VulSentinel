## Vulnerability
MeterSphere versions prior to 2.5.0 suffer from Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` (endpoint `/resource/md/get/url`). An unauthenticated attacker can force the server to issue arbitrary requests to internal resources and can chain this to reflected XSS, executing JavaScript in the MeterSphere origin context. CVSS 3.1 score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). CWE-918, CWE-79. Fixed in v2.5.0; no known workarounds.

Impact: unauthorized internal resource access and information disclosure.  
Remediation: upgrade to 2.5.0 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/resource/md/get/url?url=http://oast.pro` and matches on status 200, `text/html` header, and the string 'Interactsh Server' in the response body to confirm the SSRF successfully fetched and reflected content from the attacker-controlled OAST domain.
