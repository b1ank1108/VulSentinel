## Vulnerability
A command injection vulnerability exists in the `command` parameter of the ubus endpoint (`/ubus/`) in Razer Sila Gaming Router v2.0.441_api-2.0.418. Unauthenticated remote attackers can execute arbitrary system commands via a crafted JSON-RPC POST request.  
**CVSS:** 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE:** CWE-78  
**Impact:** Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the Razer Sila gaming router through command injection in the ubus endpoint, potentially compromising the entire home network and intercepting all network traffic.  
**Remediation:** Upgrade to a patched version of Razer Sila firmware that properly sanitizes command parameters and validates input to the ubus API.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues a single POST request to `{{BaseURL}}/ubus/` containing the JSON-RPC payload `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"call","params":["30ebdc7dd1f519beb4b2175e9dd8463e","file","exec",{"command":"id"}]}` (with Origin, Referer, and X-Requested-With headers). Detection succeeds if the response body matches the regex `uid=([0-9(a-z)]+) gid=([0-9(a-z)]+)`, the `Content-Type` header contains `application/json`, and the status is 200.
