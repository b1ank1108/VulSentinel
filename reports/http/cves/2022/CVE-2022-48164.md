## Vulnerability
An access control issue in the /cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh component of Wavlink WL-WN533A8 M33A8.V5030.190716 allows unauthenticated attackers to download configuration data and log files containing admin credentials.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). Impact includes sensitive information disclosure.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first confirms the WN533A8 device by checking the root path for the device identifier string. It then performs a direct unauthenticated GET to `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh`, matching for credential patterns (Login=, Password=), WiFi config strings, WAVLINK branding, octet-stream content-type, and HTTP 200 status.
