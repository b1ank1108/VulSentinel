## Vulnerability
Tenda AC1200 V-W15Ev2 router suffers from improper authorization and session management (CWE-287). The login page can be bypassed, granting unauthenticated attackers direct read access to `/goform/downloadSyslog/syslog.log` which contains the Administrator account's MD5 password hash. Vulnerability exists in both the local web interface and any hosted remote management console. Successful exploitation enables unauthorized data disclosure, configuration changes, and full network compromise (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single raw unauthenticated GET request to `/goform/downloadSyslog/syslog.log` supplying only the empty `Cookie: W15Ev2_user=` value. Success is confirmed via AND matchers: HTTP 200 status, response header containing `Content-type: config/conf`, body containing at least one of `[system]`, `[error]`, or `[wan1]` (OR condition), plus regex match `^0\d{3}$` on body content.
