## Vulnerability

Complete Online Job Search System 1.0 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS, CWE-79) in the advanced search feature. The flaw exists in the handling of the `SEARCH` parameter when `q=result&searchfor=advancesearch` on `index.php`.

Unauthenticated attackers can inject malicious JavaScript payloads that are reflected unescaped in the search results page. This enables execution in victims' browsers, potentially leading to session cookie theft and credential exfiltration from authenticated job seekers and employers.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (7.2)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a POST request to `/index.php?q=result&searchfor=advancesearch` containing `SEARCH=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` (and empty other fields). Detection succeeds if the response body contains the unencoded payload string 'Result : <script>alert(document.domain)</script>' along with 'ERIS', returns HTTP 200, and has text/html Content-Type.
