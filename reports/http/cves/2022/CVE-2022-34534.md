## Vulnerability
Digital Watchdog DW Spectrum Server 4.2.0.32842 allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive system information via a crafted API call to the moduleInformation endpoint. Exposed data includes network configuration, remote addresses, and cloud host details, which may facilitate further attacks (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, score 7.5, CWE-200).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/api/moduleInformation` and checks for HTTP 200 status, `application/json` content-type in headers, and presence of `"name\":", "cloudHost\":", "remoteAddresses"` in the response body to confirm the information disclosure.
