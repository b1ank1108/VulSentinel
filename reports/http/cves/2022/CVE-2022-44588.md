## Vulnerability
Cryptocurrency Widgets Pack <= 1.8.1 WordPress plugin contains an unauthenticated SQL injection (CVE-2022-44588, CWE-89) caused by unsanitized user input in database queries via the `mcwp_table` AJAX action.

Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands over the network with no authentication or user interaction required.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8).  
Impact: complete database compromise including data theft, modification, or deletion of sensitive WordPress tables.

Remediation: update plugin to version >1.8.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template performs a single raw GET request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=mcwp_table` with parameters `mcwp_id=1`, `draw=1`, `start=0`, `length=10`, and a crafted `columns[0][name]` value containing the time-based blind payload `EXP(~(SELECT*FROM(SELECT+SLEEP(8))x))` injected into an ORDER BY / column context.

Matchers verify success if response duration >= 8 seconds, HTTP status is 200, and body contains the JSON fields `recordsTotal`, `recordsFiltered`, and `draw` (standard DataTables output).

This confirms the injectable sink without performing any data modification.
