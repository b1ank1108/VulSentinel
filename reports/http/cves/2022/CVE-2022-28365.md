## Vulnerability
Reprise License Manager 14.2 is vulnerable to unauthenticated information disclosure. A simple GET request to `/goforms/rlminfo` returns details on RLM version, platform type, process IDs, network configuration, hostnames, system architecture, and file/directory paths. No authentication or special configuration is required. Exploitation can lead to further reconnaissance enabling data modification or unauthorized operations.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3)  
CWE-425 (Direct Request)  
Impact: sensitive information exposure.  
Remediation: upgrade to a patched version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/goforms/rlminfo` and confirms exposure if the response status is 200 **and** the body contains both strings `"RLM Version"` and `"Platform type"`.
