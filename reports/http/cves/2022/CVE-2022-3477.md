## Vulnerability
tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5 (required by Newspaper theme before 12.1 and Newsmag theme before 5.2.2) fails to properly implement its Facebook login feature (CWE-287). Unauthenticated attackers knowing only a target's email address can bypass authentication and log in as that user—including administrators—gaining complete account access. Fixed in 3.5. CVSS 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass
The template issues one raw POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with body `action=td_ajax_fb_login_user&user[email]={{email}}` ({{email}} supplied at runtime). It detects success via and-matchers on HTTP 200 status, text/html content-type, and the exact string `"success":"You have been successfully logged in!"` in the response body.
