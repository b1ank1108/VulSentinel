## Vulnerability
WordPress Plugin WP Statistics <= 13.1.5 is vulnerable to unauthenticated time-based SQL injection. The flaw exists due to insufficient escaping and parameterization of the `current_page_id` parameter in `~/includes/class-wp-statistics-hits.php`. 

Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries through the WP Statistics REST API (`/wp-json/wp-statistics/v2/hit`) endpoint. Successful exploitation enables extraction of the complete WordPress database, including user credentials, visitor statistics, and site analytics data. 

CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (Critical) – AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  
CWE-89  
Remediation: Update to version 13.1.6 or newer.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET request to `/` to extract the `_wpnonce` value via regex from the response body. It then sends a second GET request to `/wp-json/wp-statistics/v2/hit` injecting `current_page_id=sleep(6)` (along with the extracted nonce and other required parameters). Vulnerability is confirmed if the response satisfies all of: duration >= 6 seconds, HTTP status 200, `application/json` in headers, and body contains the string 'Visitor Hit was recorded successfully'.
