## Vulnerability
WordPress HTML2WP plugin through 1.0.0 contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. The plugin performs no authorization or CSRF checks when importing files and performs no validation on uploaded content. An unauthenticated remote attacker can therefore upload arbitrary files (including PHP webshells) directly to the server, leading to remote code execution or full unauthorized access. CVSS 3.1 score 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the flaw by issuing a raw multipart/form-data POST to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=html2wp-settings` that uploads a randomly-named `.php` file containing a benign success echo statement, then immediately performs a GET to the expected upload path `/wp-content/uploads/html2wp/{{randstr}}.php`. It asserts a 302 redirect on the upload request, a 200 on the retrieval, and the presence of the success string in the body, confirming the file was accepted and executed without any authentication or validation.
