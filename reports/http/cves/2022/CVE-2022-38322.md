## Vulnerability
Temenos Transact (formerly T24) is affected by multiple reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript payloads through the `helprequest.jsp` component by manipulating the `url` parameter, which is not properly sanitized.

**Impact:** This allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of authenticated banking sessions, potentially stealing employee credentials and session tokens.

**Remediation:** Update to a version with proper input sanitization and output encoding for the `url` parameter.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `/jsps/helprequest.jsp` with the payload `url=%27)%22+onerror=%22confirm(%27document.domain%27)%22`. It matches on the presence of the reflected string `setupHelp('')" onerror="confirm('document.domain')` in the HTML body, HTTP 200 status, and `text/html` content-type to confirm the XSS.
