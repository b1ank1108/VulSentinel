## Vulnerability
DVDFab 12 Player (recently renamed PlayerFab) is susceptible to local file inclusion (CWE-22) that lets a remote unauthenticated attacker download any file on the Windows filesystem for which the account running the player has read access. Impact is unauthorized access and information disclosure (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, score 7.5).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the flaw by sending a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/download/C%3a%2fwindows%2fsystem.ini` and checking that the response returns HTTP 200 while the body contains the exact strings "bit app support", "fonts", and "extensions" (standard contents of a legitimate Windows system.ini file).
