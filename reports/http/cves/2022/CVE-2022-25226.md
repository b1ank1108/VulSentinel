## Vulnerability
ThinVNC version 1.0b1 (vendor: cybelsoft, product: thinvnc, CPE: cpe:2.3:a:cybelsoft:thinvnc:1.0:b1:*:*:*:*:*:*) allows an unauthenticated user to bypass the authentication process via a specific command, potentially leading to unauthorized access and code execution.

Impact: An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the ThinVNC server.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (score: 10.0).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/cmd?cmd=connect` and confirms the bypass if the response status code is 200 and the body contains both `cmd":"connectStatus` and `authStatus":1`.
