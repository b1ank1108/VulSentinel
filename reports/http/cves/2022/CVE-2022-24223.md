## Vulnerability
Atom CMS v2.0 contains a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `/admin/login.php` endpoint via the `email` parameter. Unauthenticated attackers can inject SQL payloads leading to arbitrary query execution. Impact includes data leakage, unauthorized access, and data manipulation. Fixed in v2.1. CVSS 9.8 (C:H/I:H/A:H), CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a POST request to `/admin/login.php` with a sleep-based payload in the `email` field (`{{randstr}}@gmail.com'+AND+(SELECT+2549+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(6)))LIzI)+AND+'uqzM'='uqzM`) alongside a random password. It detects the vulnerability by matching on response duration >=6s, HTTP status 200, and body containing both "Admin Login" and "Atom.SaveOnBlur" (confirming the login page is returned).
