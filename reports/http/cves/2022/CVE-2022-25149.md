## Vulnerability
The WP Statistics WordPress plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient escaping and parameterization of the IP parameter found in the ~/includes/class-wp-statistics-hits.php file which allows attackers without authentication to inject arbitrary SQL queries to obtain sensitive information, in versions up to and including 13.1.5.

Unauthenticated attackers can execute time-based blind SQL injection through the IP parameter to extract sensitive database information including user credentials, posts, comments, and WordPress configuration data.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5), CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a GET request to `/` and extracts the `_wpnonce` value via regex from the response body. It then issues a second GET request to `/wp-json/wp-statistics/v2/hit` (with the extracted nonce) that injects the time-based payload `ip='-sleep(6)-'`. The vulnerability is confirmed if the response duration is >=6 seconds, status_code==200, Content-Type contains `application/json`, and the body contains the string `Visitor Hit was recorded successfully`.
