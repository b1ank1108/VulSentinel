affected_product: CMP WordPress plugin
severity: medium

affected_versions: < 4.0.19
preconditions: coming soon page feature enabled
poc_classification: state-change

## Vulnerability
The CMP WordPress plugin before version 4.0.19 is vulnerable to broken access control in its coming soon page feature. This permits unauthenticated attackers to perform arbitrary page layout modifications through insufficient authorization checks, such as injecting custom CSS via the footer background opacity parameter. Impact includes potential defacement or misleading of site visitors.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template performs version detection by fetching `/wp-content/plugins/cmp-coming-soon-maintenance/readme.txt`, extracting the stable tag, and verifying it is below 4.0.19. It then issues a POST request to `/` with URL-encoded payload `niteoCS_footer_background_opacity_hardwork=0);body{background:url({{randstr}});}div{color:red` to inject custom CSS. A follow-up GET to `/` checks for reflection of the random string in the body, along with strings indicating the CMP coming soon page is active (e.g., 'cmp-coming-soon-maintenance', 'niteoCS').
