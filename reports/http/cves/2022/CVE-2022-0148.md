## Vulnerability
The WordPress All-in-one Floating Contact Form (also known as mystickyelements) plugin before version 2.0.4 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability on the `my-sticky-elements-leads` admin page via the `search-contact` parameter.

An authenticated attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context. This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or site defacement.

CVSS v3.1: 5.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) | CWE-79 | Vendor: premio | Framework: WordPress.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a POST login to `/wp-login.php` using `{{username}}` and `{{password}}`, then issues a GET to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=my-sticky-elements-leads&search-contact=xxxx%22%3E%3Cimg+src+onerror%3Dalert%28%60document.domain%60%29+x`. It verifies the vulnerability by checking that the exact unsanitized payload string appears in the response body, the `Content-Type` header contains `text/html`, and the status code is 200.
