## Vulnerability
Online Fire Reporting System v1.0 suffers from an SQL injection vulnerability in the administrative endpoint `/admin/?page=user/manage_user` through manipulation of the `id` parameter.

Authenticated attackers can inject malicious SQL to execute arbitrary database queries, resulting in potential data exfiltration, modification, or other impacts as per the high severity rating (CVSS 7.2: AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, CWE-89).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The detection issues a GET request with a UNION SELECT payload injecting `md5(999999999)` into the vulnerable `id` parameter and checks for the corresponding MD5 hash string in the HTTP response body alongside a 200 status code. This confirms the ability to read arbitrary data from the database via SQL injection.
