## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-45836 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the W3 Eden, Inc. Download Manager plugin for WordPress, affecting versions up to and including 3.2.59. The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization of user-supplied parameters. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code that, when accessed by a victim, executes in the context of the victim's browser session. This allows attackers to perform actions such as session hijacking, credential theft, or website defacement. The vulnerability requires the attacker to socially engineer a victim into clicking a specially crafted link, but no authentication is required to trigger the XSS payload.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: detect-only

The template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request with a crafted `skw` parameter containing an XSS payload: `" onfocus="alert(document.domain)" autofocus="`. The detection verifies two conditions:

1. The server responds with HTTP status code 200
2. The response body contains both the reflected XSS payload (`onfocus="alert(document.domain)" autofocus=""`) and evidence of the Download Manager plugin (`download-manager`)

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking that the malicious JavaScript attributes are reflected unescaped in the HTML response, indicating the input sanitization flaw. While the underlying vulnerability allows arbitrary script execution, the template itself only performs detection without executing the payload.
