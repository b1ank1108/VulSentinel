## Vulnerability
Cuppa CMS v1.0 was discovered to contain a local file inclusion via the `url` parameter in `/alerts/alertLightbox.php`. Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential remote code execution, and full system compromise. CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 7.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single POST request to `/alerts/alertLightbox.php` with form data `url=../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`. It confirms the LFI by matching regex `root:[x*]:0:0` (root user entry from `/etc/passwd`) together with HTTP status 200 in the response.
