## Vulnerability
Backdrop CMS version 1.23.0 was discovered to contain a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the Page content.

Successful exploitation allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 4.8)  
CWE-79

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template executes a complete authenticated exploit chain to verify persistent unsanitized storage of attacker-controlled content:

1. GET /?q=user/login then POST login with username/password + extracted form_build_id to establish session.  
2. GET /?q=node/add/page then POST to create a page node (random title, body containing `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>` in full_html format, with all required form tokens).  
3. POST /?q={{randstr}} (where randstr = page title) to retrieve the newly created page.  
4. Matches confirm HTTP 200, text/html, unsanitized payload present in body_5, and Backdrop CMS branding.

This confirms the Page content field is stored and rendered without HTML escaping, enabling malicious content modification that executes for viewers.
