## Vulnerability
WordPress Spider Calendar plugin (by 10web, also known as spider-event-calendar) through version 1.5.65 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via the unsanitized `callback` parameter in the `window` AJAX action at `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=window`. The parameter value is echoed directly into the page output without escaping or sanitization. The endpoint is reachable by both unauthenticated and authenticated users.

An attacker can craft a malicious link that injects arbitrary JavaScript executed in the victim's browser context within the affected site, enabling theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, defacement, or further client-side attacks. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=window&callback=</script><img/src/onerror=alert(document.domain)>`. It verifies the vulnerability by confirming the response body simultaneously contains the plugin-specific string "spider_Calendar_theme" (proving the Spider Calendar handler is active) and the exact unsanitized payload, plus a 200 status code and `text/html` Content-Type header. This directly confirms reflected XSS because the injected script tag/attribute is echoed verbatim.
