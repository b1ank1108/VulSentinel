## Vulnerability
WordPress Simple Link Directory plugin before 7.7.2 contains a SQL injection vulnerability. The plugin does not validate and escape the post_id parameter before using it in a SQL statement via the qcopd_upvote_action AJAX action, available to unauthenticated and authenticated users. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, and potential compromise of the WordPress site. CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template performs a single time-based blind SQLi probe: POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with form data `action=qcopd_upvote_action&post_id=(SELECT 3 FROM (SELECT SLEEP(7))enz)`. Detection succeeds if response duration >=7s, status_code is 200 or 500, content-type contains "text/html", and body contains "vote_status" or "critical error".
