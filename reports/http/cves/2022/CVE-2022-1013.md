## Vulnerability
WordPress Personal Dictionary plugin before 1.3.4 contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied POST data before being interpolated in an SQL statement and executed. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site.

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8). CWE-89.

Fixed in version 1.3.4.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` using `action=ays_pd_ajax&function=ays_pd_game_find_word` and injects the time-based blind SQLi payload `groupsIds[]=1)+AND+(SELECT+3066+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(7)))CEHy)--+-` into the vulnerable parameter. It verifies exploitation conditions via `duration>=7`, `status_code==200`, `contains(content_type, "text/html")`, and `contains(body, "\"status\":true,")`.
