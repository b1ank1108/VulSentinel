## Vulnerability

Microweber <1.2.11 is affected by multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CWE-79) in Shop's Other Settings, Autorespond E-mail Settings, and Payment Methods. 

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (5.4). An attacker with low privileges can inject unsanitized `option_value` payloads (e.g. into checkout_url) that persist in the database and execute in the browser context of victims viewing the affected admin pages, enabling data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first authenticates by POSTing username/password to `/api/user_login`. It then stores a proof-of-concept XSS payload via POST `/api/save_option` (option_key=checkout_url, option_group=shop). Finally, it loads the settings module via POST `/module/` and matches on the unsanitized payload appearing in the HTML response body alongside correct headers and status code 200.
