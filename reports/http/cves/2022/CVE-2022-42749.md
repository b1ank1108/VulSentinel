## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-42749 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in CandidATS version 3.0.0. The vulnerability exists in the `ajax.php` resource, specifically in the `page` parameter of the `getPipelineJobOrder` function. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it in the HTTP response, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. When exploited, this vulnerability enables an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a victim's browser session, potentially leading to theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, session hijacking, or other client-side attacks. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity), requiring user interaction (UI:R) but no authentication (PR:N) to exploit.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the `/ajax.php` endpoint with malicious XSS payloads injected into the `page` and `indexFile` parameters. The payload `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` attempts to break out of the HTML context and inject JavaScript code. The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for three conditions: (1) the injected script tag `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` is reflected in the response body, (2) the string "candidat" appears in the response (confirming the target is CandidATS), and (3) the response has a 404 status code with a `text/html` content type. The detection confirms that user input is reflected without proper sanitization, making the application vulnerable to XSS attacks.
