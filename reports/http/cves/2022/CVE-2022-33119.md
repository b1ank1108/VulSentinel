## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-33119 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in NUUO NVRsolo Video Recorder firmware version 03.06.02. The vulnerability exists in the login.php page, where user-supplied input via the Referer header is not properly sanitized before being reflected in the HTTP response. An attacker can craft a malicious URL or manipulate the Referer header to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the context of a victim's browser session. Successful exploitation could lead to session hijacking, credential theft, website defacement, or other client-side attacks. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity), requiring user interaction but no authentication.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending a POST request to `/login.php` with a malicious Referer header containing an XSS payload: `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script><"`. The request includes standard login form parameters (language, user, pass, submit) in the POST body. The template verifies the vulnerability by checking three conditions: (1) the response has a Content-Type header containing "text/html", (2) the HTTP status code is 200, and (3) the response body contains the reflected XSS payload `<script>alert(document.domain)</script><\"?cmd=`, indicating that the injected script was not properly sanitized and is present in the HTML output. This confirms the application is vulnerable to reflected XSS through the Referer header manipulation.
