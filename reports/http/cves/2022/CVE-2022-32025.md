## Vulnerability
Car Rental Management System 1.0 contains a SQL injection (CWE-89) in the `id` parameter of `/admin/view_car.php`. The flaw permits arbitrary SQL query execution in the context of the database user, enabling extraction of sensitive data, data modification, or unauthorized administrative operations.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 7.2).  
The endpoint is reachable only after successful admin authentication (PR:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template issues a POST login request to `/admin/ajax.php?action=login` with a username payload terminated by `%23` (`#`) followed by a GET to `/admin/view_car.php?id=-1%20union%20select%201,md5(999999999),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10--+`. It then verifies that the rendered MD5 hash value appears verbatim in the HTTP response body, confirming union-based injection and exfiltration of query results.
