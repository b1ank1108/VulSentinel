## Vulnerability
Hospital Management System 1.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability. The flaw allows injection of arbitrary SQL queries, enabling an attacker to obtain sensitive information from the database, modify data, and execute unauthorized administrative operations. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation. CVSS v3.1: 7.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single POST request to `/hms/admin/` containing the URL-encoded SQL injection payload `username=admin%27+or+%271%27%3D%271%27%23&password=admin%27+or+%271%27%3D%271%27%23&submit=`. It verifies success with an AND matcher requiring HTTP 200 status and the response body containing all of: `<title>Admin  | Dashboard</title>`, `Manage Patients`, and `Manage Doctors`.
