## Vulnerability
Barco Control Room Management Suite <=2.9 Build 0275 is vulnerable to local file inclusion via directory traversal. The flaw is triggered specifically when HTTP requests begin with the substring `GET /..\..`, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files on the server filesystem (including system and application configuration files) and access sensitive components. CWE-22. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5). Impact includes full information disclosure; remediation requires upgrade beyond 2.9 Build 0275.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues one raw unsafe HTTP GET request to `/..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\windows\win.ini` (Host header only) and matches on response body containing all three strings `"bit app support"`, `"fonts"`, and `"extensions"`. This non-destructive probe confirms successful path traversal and file read by retrieving the standard Windows `win.ini` contents.
