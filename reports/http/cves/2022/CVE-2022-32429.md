## Vulnerability
MSNSwitch Firmware MNT.2408 is vulnerable to authentication bypass (CWE-287) in the settings export component. Unauthenticated attackers can access `/cgi-bin-hax/ExportSettings.sh` (referenced as `/cgi-bin-sdb/ExportSettings.sh` in description) to download device configuration data. This enables arbitrary configuration changes, potential remote code execution, and full unauthorized device control. CVSS 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/cgi-bin-hax/ExportSettings.sh`. It verifies successful bypass by matching response body for string "SSID1", Content-Disposition header containing `filename="Settings(.*).dat"`, Content-Type `application/octet-stream`, and HTTP status 200.
