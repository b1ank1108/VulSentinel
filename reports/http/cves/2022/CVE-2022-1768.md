## Vulnerability

WordPress RSVPMaker plugin through version 9.3.2 is vulnerable to SQL injection in `rsvpmaker-email.php` due to insufficient escaping and parameterization of user-supplied data in multiple SQL queries. The flaw is reachable via the public `/wp-json/rsvpmaker/v1/stripesuccess/` REST endpoint.

**CVSS v3.1:** 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)  
**CWE-89**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')  
**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows arbitrary SQL query execution, leading to sensitive data exposure, data manipulation, and unauthorized administrative operations.  
**Remediation:** Update to version 9.3.3 or higher.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/wp-json/rsvpmaker/v1/stripesuccess/anythinghere` with form data containing the time-based blind SQLi payload `rsvp_id=(select(0)from(select(sleep(7)))a)`. Detection succeeds if the response duration is >=7 seconds (confirming payload execution), the body contains `"payment_confirmation_message":`, the `Content-Type` header includes `application/json`, and status code is 200.
