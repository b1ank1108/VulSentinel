## Vulnerability

Oracle E-Business Suite versions 12.2.3 through 12.2.11 contains a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Oracle Web Applications Desktop Integrator product, specifically in the Upload component. The vulnerability stems from improper authentication controls (CWE-306) that allow unauthenticated attackers with HTTP network access to upload arbitrary files through the BneOfflineLOVService endpoint.

An attacker can exploit this flaw to upload malicious files including scripts to the server without providing any credentials. This enables complete compromise of the affected system, allowing attackers to execute malware, obtain sensitive information, modify data, and gain full control over the server. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical) with an EPSS score of 0.94397 (99.974th percentile), indicating active exploitation in the wild. It is listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template performs a two-stage detection process to verify the remote code execution vulnerability:

1. **File Upload Stage**: Sends a POST request to `/OA_HTML/BneOfflineLOVService?bne:uueupload=true` with a multipart/form-data payload containing a UUEncoded ZIP file named "taintedlove.zip". The ZIP contains a JSP file (taint.jsp) with a unique identifier. The template verifies successful upload by checking for a 200 status code and "text/xml" content-type header in the response.

2. **Verification Stage**: Attempts to access the uploaded JSP file at `/forms/taint.jsp`. Successful exploitation is confirmed if the response contains the unique identifier string "061ea306-46ef-11f0-ad94-f3d183b0689a" and returns a 200 status code, proving arbitrary file upload and execution capabilities.

The template uses flow control (`flow: http(1) && http(2)`) to ensure both stages execute sequentially, with the second request only proceeding if the first succeeds.
