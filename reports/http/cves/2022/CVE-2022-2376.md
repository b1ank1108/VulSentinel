## Vulnerability
WordPress Directorist plugin before 7.3.1 is susceptible to information disclosure. The plugin discloses the email address of all users in an AJAX action available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users.

An attacker can gain sensitive information about the WordPress installation, potentially leading to further attacks.

Fixed in version 7.3.1.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (score 5.3)  
CWE-862

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=directorist_author_pagination` and confirms the vulnerability if the response body contains both `directorist-authors__card__details__top` and `directorist-authors__card__info-list`, the header contains `text/html`, and the status is 200. This verifies the endpoint is returning the author listing HTML that includes user email data.
