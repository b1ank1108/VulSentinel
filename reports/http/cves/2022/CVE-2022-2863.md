## Vulnerability
WordPress WPvivid Backup plugin versions <0.9.76 is vulnerable to local file inclusion because the plugin does not sanitize and validate a parameter before using it to read the content of a file, allowing high privilege users to read any file from the web server.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 4.9). CWE-22 (Path Traversal). Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive files (e.g. wp-config.php, /etc/passwd), potential remote code execution, and full WordPress installation compromise. Fixed by upgrading to 0.9.76 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template logs in via POST /wp-login.php with supplied {{username}}/{{password}}, visits /wp-admin/admin.php?page=WPvivid to extract the _ajax_nonce value, then issues a GET to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with action=wpvivid_download_export_backup&file_name=../../../../../../../etc/passwd. Success is confirmed by HTTP 200 status and regex match for "root:.*:0:0:" in the response body (proof of arbitrary file read via path traversal).
