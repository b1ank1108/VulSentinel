## Vulnerability
WordPress Copyright Proof plugin <=4.16 (digiprove/copyright_proof for WordPress) is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2022-1906, CWE-79). The flaw occurs in the `dprv_log_event` AJAX action because the `message` parameter is neither sanitized nor escaped before being echoed in the response. The endpoint is reachable by unauthenticated users when a specific plugin setting is enabled. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript into pages viewed by other users, enabling data theft, session hijacking, or website defacement.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a direct reflected-XSS probe by issuing a single unauthenticated GET request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=dprv_log_event&message=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E` and verifying that the unsanitized payload string "got message <script>alert(document.domain)</script>" appears verbatim in the response body, the Content-Type header contains "text/html", and the HTTP status is 200.
