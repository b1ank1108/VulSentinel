## Vulnerability
WordPress NotificationX plugin versions prior to 2.3.9 contain an unauthenticated blind SQL injection vulnerability. The `nx_id` parameter is not sanitized or escaped before use in a SQL statement at the REST endpoint `/?rest_route=/notificationx/v1/analytics`.

Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, obtaining sensitive information, modifying data, and performing unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected WordPress site.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8) | CWE-89

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template sends a single POST request to `/?rest_route=/notificationx/v1/analytics` with the time-based payload `nx_id=sleep(6) -- x` and matches on response duration >=6 seconds, status_code == 200, and body containing `"data":{"success":true}"` to confirm the injection point.

This probe verifies the underlying SQL injection flaw that permits data modification and unauthorized administrative operations.
