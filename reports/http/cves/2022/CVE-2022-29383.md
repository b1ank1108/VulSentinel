## Vulnerability
NETGEAR ProSafe SSL VPN firmware contains an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability via the `USERDBDomains.Domainname` parameter at `/scgi-bin/platform.cgi`. Multiple firmware versions are affected. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary SQL commands, resulting in unauthorized access, data leakage, or denial of service. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 9.8, CWE-89). Remediation requires applying the latest firmware update from NETGEAR.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the vulnerability by performing boolean-based SQL injection testing. It sends two raw POST requests to `/scgi-bin/platform.cgi` with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` containing form fields for a simulated login (empty password, fixed username) and injects `'AND+'5434'%3d'5435'` (false condition) in the first request and `'AND+'5434'%3d'5434'` (true condition) in the second request into the `USERDBDomains.Domainname` field. Matchers use a DSL condition (`and`) to confirm `body_1` contains "User authentication Failed" while `body_2` contains "User Login Failed for SSLVPN User.", proving differential response behavior that discloses the SQL injection flaw and enables unauthorized data extraction.
