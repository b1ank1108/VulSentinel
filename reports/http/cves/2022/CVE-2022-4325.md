## Vulnerability

WordPress Post Status Notifier Lite plugin versions before 1.10.1 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the `controller` parameter in the plugin's settings page before outputting it back in the response. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the context of the affected WordPress site.

The vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it can be exploited against high-privilege users such as administrators. Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, perform actions on behalf of the victim user, hijack sessions, or launch further attacks against the WordPress installation.

The CVSS v3.1 score is 6.1 (Medium), with the vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, indicating network-based exploitation with low attack complexity, no privileges required, but requiring user interaction, with changed scope and low confidentiality and integrity impact.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: state-change

The template performs authenticated exploitation testing by:

1. **Authentication Step**: First, it sends a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with WordPress administrator credentials to establish an authenticated session.

2. **XSS Injection**: After authentication, it sends a GET request to the plugin's settings page at `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=post-status-notifier-lite` with a malicious `controller` parameter containing JavaScript payload: `<script>alert(\`document.domain\`)</script>`.

3. **Verification**: The template confirms successful exploitation by checking:
   - HTTP 200 status code
   - Content-Type header contains "text/html"
   - Response body reflects the injected script tag without sanitization
   - Response contains "Post Status Notifier Lite" text confirming the correct plugin page

The detection confirms the XSS vulnerability is exploitable in authenticated contexts, allowing malicious script injection that could be used for session hijacking, credential theft, or unauthorized administrative actions.
