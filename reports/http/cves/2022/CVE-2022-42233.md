## Vulnerability
Tenda 11N (11n_firmware) version V5.07.33_cn contains an authentication bypass (CWE-287). Unauthenticated remote attackers can set the `admin` cookie to impersonate an administrator and obtain full read/write access to the router configuration, enabling sensitive data exposure, configuration changes, and network compromise. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.8). Impact explicitly includes unauthenticated full administrative operations on self-hosted Tenda 11N wireless routers/APs. Remediation requires applying the latest firmware from Tenda.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template issues one raw GET request to `/index.asp` supplying the header `Cookie: admin`. It matches on HTTP 200 status, `GoAhead-Webs` in the response header, and the body containing both `def_wirelesspassword` and `Tenda 11N` (case-insensitive). Positive match confirms the device grants administrative interface access without valid credentials.
