## Vulnerability
WordPress Awin Data Feed plugin versions 1.6 and prior (CVE-2022-1937, CWE-79) contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. The `title` parameter in the `get_sw_product` AJAX action is not sanitized or escaped before being output in the HTML response. The issue exists in the AJAX handler and is reachable by both unauthenticated and authenticated users.  

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (6.1).  
Impact includes arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context, enabling session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information (cookies, credentials).  
Remediation: update to a version >1.6.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  

The template first sends a POST to `/wp-login.php` with `log={{username}}&pwd={{password}}` to authenticate, then issues a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_sw_product&title=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E`. Detection succeeds if the second response returns status 200, Content-Type text/html, and the response body contains the unsanitized payload reflected inside a `<th colspan="2">` element.
