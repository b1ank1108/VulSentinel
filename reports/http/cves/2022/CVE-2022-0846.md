## Vulnerability
Unauthenticated SQL injection in the SpeakOut Email Petitions WordPress plugin via the unsanitized `id` parameter passed directly into a SQL statement in the `dk_speakout_sendmail` AJAX action.

The SpeakOut! Email Petitions WordPress plugin before 2.14.15.1 does not sanitise and escape the id parameter before using it in a SQL statement via the dk_speakout_sendmail AJAX action, leading to an SQL Injection exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows arbitrary SQL query execution, resulting in unauthorized access, full data leakage, or data manipulation.  
**CVSS:** 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**CWE:** CWE-89  
**Remediation:** Update to 2.14.15.1 or later.  
**Metadata:** verified, WordPress plugin, vendor speakout!_email_petitions_project, product speakout!_email_petitions.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template issues one raw POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` containing `action=dk_speakout_sendmail&id=12+AND+(SELECT+5023+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(6)))Fvrh)--+VoFu`. It confirms the SQL injection by matching `duration>=6`, HTTP 200, text/html content-type, and presence of either "Your signature has been added" or "This petition has already been signed using your email address" in the response body.
