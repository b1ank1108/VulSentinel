## Vulnerability
WAVLINK WN535 G3 firmware M35G3R.V5030.180927 is susceptible to improper access control in `/cgi-bin/ExportAllSettings.sh`. Unauthenticated remote attackers can export all device settings via a simple GET request, leaking sensitive configuration data including login credentials (`Login=`, `Password=`), model details, and authentication modes.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5 High). Impact includes obtainment of sensitive information and potential network compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/cgi-bin/ExportAllSettings.sh` and matches on HTTP 200 status together with the simultaneous presence of the strings 'Login=', 'Password=', 'Model=', and 'AuthMode=' in the response body to confirm exposure of the router's full settings export.
