## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-31656 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability affecting VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager, and vRealize Automation. The vulnerability allows a malicious actor with network access to the UI to obtain administrative access without authentication, specifically affecting local domain users. The flaw enables local file inclusion attacks, permitting unauthorized reading of sensitive server files including credentials, configuration files, and other confidential information. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating critical severity with high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by attempting to exploit the authentication bypass and local file inclusion flaw. It sends a GET request to the path `/SAAS/t/_/;/WEB-INF/web.xml`, which uses path traversal techniques to bypass authentication and access the WEB-INF directory containing the web.xml configuration file. The template verifies successful exploitation by checking for:

1. The presence of XML elements `<web-app>` and `<servlet-name>` in the response body, indicating successful retrieval of the web.xml file
2. A Content-Type header of `application/xml`
3. An HTTP 200 status code

The detection confirms that the server is vulnerable to both authentication bypass and local file inclusion, as it successfully retrieves a protected configuration file without providing any credentials.
