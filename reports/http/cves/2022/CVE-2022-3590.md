## Vulnerability
WordPress <= 6.2 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the pingback feature. A TOCTOU race condition between validation checks and the HTTP request allows attackers to bypass restrictions and reach internal hosts that are explicitly forbidden.

**Impact:** Unauthenticated attackers can perform blind SSRF attacks to access internal network resources, cloud metadata endpoints, or other restricted internal services.

**Remediation:** Update WordPress to version 6.0.3 or later to properly handle the TOCTOU race condition in the pingback feature.

**Classification details:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 5.9), CWE-367.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` (with host-redirects and max-redirects=2) and matches a regex on the body to confirm a vulnerable WordPress version (`WordPress\s+(?:[1-5]\.\d+(?:\.\d+)?|6\.[0-2](?:\.\d+)?)`). It then issues a raw POST to `/xmlrpc.php` with an XML-RPC `pingback.ping` call: first parameter is `http://{{interactsh-url}}/`, second parameter is `{{RootURL}}/?p=1`. Detection succeeds if the response is status 200, contains `<methodResponse>`, `faultCode`, `<fault>`, has `text/xml` content-type, and an OOB DNS interaction is recorded via interactsh.
