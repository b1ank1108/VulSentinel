## Vulnerability
WordPress Helloprint plugin before 1.4.7 is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `success` parameter before outputting it on the `language-translate.php` admin page. An attacker can inject arbitrary script that executes in the context of an unsuspecting victim's browser (typically an authenticated administrator), enabling theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and further client-side attacks.

Impact: Successful exploitation leads to XSS attacks.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).  
Remediation: Update to version 1.4.7 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first executes a POST login to `/wp-login.php` supplying `{{username}}` and `{{password}}` to reach the authenticated admin area. It then sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=language-translate.php&success=added"><script>alert(`XSS`)</script>` and verifies exploitation conditions via DSL matchers confirming HTTP 200, HTML content-type, and exact reflection of the unsanitized payload inside the success message string in the response body.
