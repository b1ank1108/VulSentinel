## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-31845 is an information disclosure vulnerability affecting WAVLINK WN535 G3 routers running firmware version M35G3R.V5030.180927. The vulnerability exists in the `live_check.shtml` endpoint, which exposes sensitive router information without requiring authentication. An attacker can execute the exec cmd function through this endpoint to obtain sensitive router details including model information, firmware version, and network configuration data such as LAN IP addresses. This exposure can facilitate further attacks by providing reconnaissance data about the target device's configuration and potentially enable unauthorized access, data modification, or execution of unauthorized operations.

The CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 (High) reflects the network-accessible attack vector with low complexity, no privileges required, and high confidentiality impact. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) and has a high EPSS score of 0.61681 (98.295th percentile), indicating significant real-world exploitation likelihood.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the `/live_check.shtml` endpoint on the target host. The template verifies the presence of the vulnerability by checking for three specific indicators in the response body that confirm exposure of sensitive router information:
- `Model=` - indicating device model information disclosure
- `FW_Version=` - indicating firmware version exposure
- `LanIP=` - indicating internal network IP address disclosure

The detection requires all three strings to be present in the response along with a 200 OK HTTP status code. The template uses a 10-second timeout to accommodate potentially slow router responses. This detection method confirms that sensitive system information is accessible without authentication, demonstrating the information disclosure vulnerability.
