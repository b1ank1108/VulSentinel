affected_product: SINEMA Remote Connect Server

## Vulnerability
SINEMA Remote Connect Server (all versions < V2.0) contains an open redirect (CWE-601) in the WBM login flow. The `?next=` parameter on `/wbm/login/` is reflected unsanitized into the `Location` header after successful POST login, allowing arbitrary external redirects.  
An attacker crafts `https://target/wbm/login/?next=https://evil.com` and tricks an authenticated user into visiting it; after the victim supplies credentials, the browser is redirected to the attacker domain.  
Impact: phishing, credential harvesting, or malware delivery.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1).  
Remediation: upgrade to V2.0 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: detect-only  
The template verifies the open redirect by simulating a full login sequence with attacker-supplied credentials:  
1. GET `/wbm/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Finteract.sh` to fetch the login page and extract `csrfmiddlewaretoken`.  
2. POST `/wbm/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Finteract.sh` with `csrfmiddlewaretoken`, username, password, and `utcoffset`.  
3. Regex-matches the `Location` header of the second response for a redirect containing `interact.sh`.
