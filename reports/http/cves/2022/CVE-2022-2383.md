## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-2383 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WordPress Feed Them Social plugin versions prior to 3.0.1. The vulnerability exists because the plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page response. Specifically, the `expires_in` parameter in the `fts_refresh_token_ajax` AJAX action is vulnerable to XSS injection.

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium severity). The attack vector is network-based with low attack complexity, requires no privileges but does require user interaction, and has a changed scope with low confidentiality and integrity impact.

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or website defacement.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template performs a two-stage detection process:

1. **Plugin Verification**: First, it checks for the presence of the Feed Them Social plugin by requesting `/wp-content/plugins/feed-them-social/readme.txt` and verifying the response contains both "Feed Them Social" and "Tags:" strings.

2. **XSS Vulnerability Detection**: If the plugin is present, it sends a GET request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action `fts_refresh_token_ajax`, feed parameter set to `instagram`, and the `expires_in` parameter containing an XSS payload: `<img src onerror=alert(document.domain)>`.

The template confirms the vulnerability by checking that:
- The response body contains the reflected XSS payload: `<img src onerror=alert(document.domain)><br/>`
- The response Content-Type header is `text/html`
- The HTTP status code is 200

This demonstrates that the parameter is reflected without proper sanitization, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
