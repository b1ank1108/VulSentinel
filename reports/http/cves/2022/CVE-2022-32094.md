## Vulnerability
Hospital Management System 1.0 contains a SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89, CVE-2022-32094). The issue is described as affecting the `editid` parameter in `/HMS/doctor.php`; the provided detection template targets the login form at `/hms/doctor/`. An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, obtain sensitive information from the database, modify data, and execute unauthorized administrative operations.

**Impact**: Full database compromise possible, including unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation.  
**CVSS 3.1**: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
**Remediation**: Upgrade to the latest version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template sends a single unauthenticated POST request to `/hms/doctor/` with the boolean-based SQL injection payload `admin' or '1'='1'#` injected into both the `username` and `password` form fields. Detection succeeds on HTTP 200 responses containing both `<title>Doctor  | Dashboard</title>` and `View Appointment History`.
