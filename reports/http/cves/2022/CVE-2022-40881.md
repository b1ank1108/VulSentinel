## Vulnerability
SolarView Compact 6.00 is affected by an unauthenticated command injection (CWE-77) in `network_test.php`. The flaw allows remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands via newline injection (`%0a`) in the `host` form parameter, leading to full system compromise (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H score 9.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template issues a single unauthenticated POST request to `/network_test.php` containing `host=%0a{{cmd}}%0a&command=ping` (with `cmd=cat${IFS}/etc/passwd`) and confirms exploitation by matching the regex `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body together with HTTP 200 status.
