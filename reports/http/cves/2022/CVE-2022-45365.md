## Vulnerability
WordPress Stock Ticker plugin (versions <= 3.23.2) vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in `ajax_stockticker_symbol_search_test` AJAX handler due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `endpoint` parameter. Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in a victim's browser if the victim is tricked into clicking a crafted link. Impact includes theft of WordPress user session cookies and credentials. Fixed in 3.23.3. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=stockticker_symbol_search_test&symbol=test&endpoint=<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>` (HTML-encoded). Detection succeeds if the response (status 200, text/html) contains both the literal "Stock Ticker Fatal" string and the unsanitized payload reflection `<IMG SRC=X ONERROR=`.
