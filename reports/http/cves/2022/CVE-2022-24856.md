## Vulnerability

Flyte Console <0.52.0 suffers from server-side request forgery (SSRF, CWE-918) in the `/cors_proxy` endpoint. Internet-facing instances allow unauthenticated attackers to force the server to request internal metadata servers or other internal/unauthenticated resources. Header passing to unauthorized parties is also possible.

Impact includes unauthorized internal access and potential further attacks. Fixed in 0.52.0 by removing cors_proxy (or disable console entirely).

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/cors_proxy/https://oast.me/` and checks the response for the word "Interactsh Server" to confirm successful out-of-band SSRF callback.
