**CVSS 3.1**: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce  
The template issues a raw POST request to `/conf_mail.php` with the payload `mail_address=%3Bcat${IFS}/etc/passwd%3B&button=%83%81%81%5B%83%8B%91%97%90M` to inject and execute the command, then matches the response body for the regex `root:.*:0:0` (proof of /etc/passwd output) and the word `p1_network_mail.cgi`.
