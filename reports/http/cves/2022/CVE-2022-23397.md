## Vulnerability
Cedar Gate EZ-NET (including versions 6.5.5 through 6.8.0) is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. The `AlertMessages.aspx` page fails to sanitize the `Usertext` URL parameter, allowing arbitrary JavaScript injection that executes in the context of the victim's browser (e.g., an authenticated administrator).

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79. Impact includes potential theft of session cookies or execution of administrative actions if the victim visits an attacker-controlled link.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a single GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/EZ-NET60/AlertMessages.aspx?Usertext=<img%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert(document.domain)>` and matches on the unsanitized payload appearing verbatim in the response body (`"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)></span>"`), `text/html` content-type, and HTTP 200 status.
