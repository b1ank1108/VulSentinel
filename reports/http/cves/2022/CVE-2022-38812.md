## Vulnerability
AeroCMS 0.1.1 contains a SQL injection caused by unsanitized `author` parameter in `author_posts.php` (and `/cms/author_posts.php`). Authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands to extract sensitive database information including user credentials, content data, and application configuration. Remediation requires updating to a version newer than 0.1.1 with proper sanitization and parameterized queries.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues GET requests to both `/author_posts.php` and `/cms/author_posts.php` injecting a UNION ALL SELECT payload with `CONCAT(md5(999999999),1,1)` (stop-at-first-match). It verifies successful injection by matching the computed MD5 hash string in the response body alongside HTTP 200 status.
