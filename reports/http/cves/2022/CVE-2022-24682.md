## Vulnerability
Zimbra Collaboration Suite 8.8.x before 8.8.15 patch 30 (update 1) contains an improper encoding flaw in the Calendar feature. An attacker can place HTML with executable JavaScript inside element attributes; the markup is not escaped and is injected directly into the document, executing in the victim's browser context. CVSS 3.1: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, CWE-116). Known exploited in the wild since December 2021. Impact includes session token theft and unauthorized access to victim email communications. Remediation requires updating to 8.8.15 patch 30 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/js/zimbraMail/share/model/ZmSettings.js`. It verifies the response body contains "Zimbra Collaboration Suite Web Client", the content-type is application/x-javascript, extracts the CLIENT_VERSION string via regex, and applies DSL matchers to confirm the version satisfies both `> 8.7.15` and `< 8.8.15`. No payload is sent and no XSS is triggered; detection is purely passive version fingerprinting.
