## Vulnerability
WBCE CMS v1.5.4 is affected by a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `/admin/users/index.php`. Attackers with administrative access can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML via the Display Name field when creating or editing users. The payload is persisted and executes automatically in the browser context of any user (including other administrators) who views the users list page.

**Impact**: Data theft, session hijacking, or defacement via malicious scripts.  
**CVSS v3.1**: 5.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  
**CWE**: 79

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first performs a login sequence (GET login page to extract dynamic field names, followed by POST with supplied admin credentials). It then GETs the users index page, POSTs a new user record with the payload `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` in the `display_name` field (along with required formtoken and other parameters), and finally GETs `/admin/users/` to confirm the raw script tag is reflected unescaped in the response body (matched together with "SESSION_TIMEOUT", text/html Content-Type, and HTTP 200).
