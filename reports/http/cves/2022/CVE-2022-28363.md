## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-28363 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Reprise License Manager version 14.2. The vulnerability exists in the `/goform/login_process` endpoint, specifically in the 'username' parameter when accessed via GET request. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, making it accessible to unauthenticated attackers. The flaw is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) with a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session. This can lead to session hijacking, website defacement, theft of sensitive information, or other client-side attacks. The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R), as the victim must be tricked into clicking a malicious link or visiting a crafted URL.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The Nuclei template detects this vulnerability by sending a GET request to the `/goform/login_process` endpoint with a crafted XSS payload in the username parameter: `test"><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`. 

The template verifies the vulnerability through three conditions:
1. The response body contains the injected XSS payload `<svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`, indicating the input was reflected without proper sanitization
2. The response body contains the text "Login Failed", confirming the request reached the login processing logic
3. The response has a 200 status code and Content-Type header of "text/html"

The presence of the unescaped SVG tag with JavaScript event handler in the HTML response confirms that user input is reflected without proper encoding or validation, making the application vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.
