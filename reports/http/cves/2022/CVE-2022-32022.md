## Vulnerability
Car Rental Management System 1.0 contains an SQL injection vulnerability via `/admin/ajax.php?action=login`. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information from a database, modify data, and execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site.  
Impact: Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access, data leakage, and potential manipulation of the database.  
Remediation: Upgrade to the latest version.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 7.2). CWE-89.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass  
The template detects the vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to `/admin/ajax.php?action=login` containing the SQL injection payload `username=admin'+or+'1'%3D'1'%23&password=admin`, followed by a GET request to `/admin/index.php?page=home`. It confirms success via an `and` matcher requiring HTTP 200 status plus the presence of `'Welcome back Administrator!'`, `'action=logout'`, and `'Manage Account'` in the response body.
