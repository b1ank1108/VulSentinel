## Vulnerability
HP Switch (Hewlett Packard Enterprise OfficeConnect 1820, 1850, and 1920S Network switches) is affected by CVE-2022-37932. A potential security vulnerability allows remote authentication bypass on affected firmware. Attackers on the adjacent network can bypass authentication without credentials, gaining administrative access to modify switch configurations, intercept network traffic, or disrupt operations. CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (score 8.8).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template first issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/`, matching status_code == 200 and body containing `<title>HPE OfficeConnect Switch 1920` to fingerprint the target device. It then sends raw POST requests (with fallback path) to `/login/default_password_cfg.lua` (or `/htdocs/login/default_password_cfg.lua`) using form data `username=admin&oldPwd=&newPwd={{rand_base(8)}}&confirmPwd={{rand_base(8)}}`. Success is confirmed via status_code == 200, body containing "redirect", and content_type containing "application/json". The template extracts the generated password and redirect path. The detection actively modifies the admin password on vulnerable instances.
