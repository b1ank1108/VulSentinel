## Vulnerability
iSpy 7.2.2.0 is vulnerable to authentication bypass (CVE-2022-29775, CWE-287). An unauthenticated remote attacker can craft a specific URL to bypass authentication controls, obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations. 

**CVSS 3.1**: 9.8 (Critical) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Impact**: Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential full system compromise.

**Remediation**: Upgrade to iSpy 7.2.2.1 or higher.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The Nuclei template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/logfile?d=crossdomain.xml` (no authentication, cookies, or credentials) and matches on HTTP 200 status, `text/html` Content-Type header, and the simultaneous presence of the words "Log Start", "Log File", and "iSpy" in the response body. A match confirms the logfile endpoint (and therefore authentication) is bypassed.
