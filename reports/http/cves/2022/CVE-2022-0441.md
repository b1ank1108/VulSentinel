## Vulnerability
MasterStudy LMS WordPress plugin before 2.7.6 suffers from improper access control in the user registration process (`stm_lms_register` AJAX action). The plugin does not validate the `profile_default_fields_for_register` parameter, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject administrator role capabilities (`wp_capabilities: {"value": {"administrator": 1}}`) during account creation. This permits registration as an admin, enabling full site control.

**Impact**: Attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive information, can modify data, and execute arbitrary operations.  
**CVSS 3.1**: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template actively exploits the flaw for detection: it first performs a GET to `/` and extracts the `stm_lms_register` nonce via regex from the response body (internal extractor), then issues a POST to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=stm_lms_register` with a JSON payload containing randomly generated username/email/password and the administrator capability override. Verification succeeds on HTTP 200, `application/json` content-type, and body containing both 'Registration completed successfully' and '"status":"success"'. This results in creation of a new admin account on vulnerable instances.
