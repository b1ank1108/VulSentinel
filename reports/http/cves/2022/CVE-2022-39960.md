## Vulnerability

The Jira Netic Group Export add-on versions prior to 1.0.3 contain a missing authorization vulnerability (CWE-862). The add-on fails to perform authorization checks on the group export functionality, allowing unauthenticated users to export all groups from the Jira instance. This vulnerability enables unauthorized access to potentially sensitive group information including group names and associated data structures. The flaw exists in the `/plugins/servlet/groupexportforjira/admin/` endpoint which processes group export requests without validating user permissions.

The CVSS v3.1 score is 5.3 (Medium) with vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, indicating network-exploitable access with low complexity, no privileges required, and confidentiality impact. The EPSS score of 0.53199 (97.91 percentile) suggests a relatively high probability of exploitation in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated POST request to `/plugins/servlet/groupexportforjira/admin/json` with parameters `groupexport_searchstring=&groupexport_download=true`. This simulates an attempt to export group data without authentication.

The detection verifies successful exploitation through three conditions:
1. Response body contains JSON fields `"jiraGroupObjects"` and `"groupName"`, indicating group data was returned
2. Response headers include `attachment` and `jira-group-export`, confirming the server is attempting to deliver an export file
3. HTTP status code 200, indicating successful request processing

The template confirms the missing authorization vulnerability by demonstrating that group export data can be retrieved without any authentication credentials.
