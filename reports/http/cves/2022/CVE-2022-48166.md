## Vulnerability
An access control issue in Wavlink WL-WN530HG4 firmware M30HG4.V5030.201217 allows unauthenticated attackers to download configuration data and log files via the exposed `/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` endpoint and obtain admin credentials along with WiFi settings and other sensitive information.  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (score 7.5).  
Impact: Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure.  
Remediation: Apply the latest firmware updates from Wavlink or implement network segmentation to restrict access to the device administration interface.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template first issues a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}` (internal matcher) to fingerprint the device by confirming the string "WN530HG4" is present in the response body. It then performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/cgi-bin/ExportLogs.sh` and verifies the condition with a DSL matcher requiring all of: response body contains "Login=", "Password=", "WiFi_", "WAVLINK"; `Content-Type` header contains "application/octet-stream" and "filename=\""; and HTTP status code 200. This confirms the unauthenticated download of the log file containing credentials.
