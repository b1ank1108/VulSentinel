## Vulnerability
WordPress WP JobSearch plugin prior to 1.5.1 contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. The flaw is triggered via the `search_title` parameter. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (score 6.1). CWE-79.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/plugins/jobsearch/?search_title=%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert%28domain%29%3E&ajax_filter=true&posted=all&sort-by=recent`. It verifies exploitation by matching the exact unsanitized payload string in the response body (together with the plugin identifier "wp-jobsearch"), confirming `text/html` Content-Type header, and HTTP 404 status.
