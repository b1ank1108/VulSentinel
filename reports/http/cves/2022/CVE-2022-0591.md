## Vulnerability
Formcraft3 WordPress plugin fails to validate the `URL` parameter in the `formcraft3_get` AJAX action, resulting in Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF, CWE-918) exploitable by unauthenticated users.  
An attacker can send crafted requests to the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal resources or network scanning.  
CVSS: 9.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).  
Remediation: Upgrade to Formcraft3 version 3.8.28 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template first issues a GET to `{{BaseURL}}` and uses an internal word matcher to confirm the Formcraft3 plugin path (`/wp-content/plugins/formcraft3/`). It then issues a GET to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=formcraft3_get&URL=https://{{interactsh-url}}` to trigger the SSRF. Detection confirms exploitation when an OOB HTTP interaction arrives at the interactsh server with protocol "http" and User-Agent containing "WordPress".
