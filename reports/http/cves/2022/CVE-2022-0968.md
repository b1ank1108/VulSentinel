## Vulnerability
Microweber before 1.2.12 is susceptible to integer overflow (CWE-190). The application allows excessively large input in the first and last name fields, which can be abused via a crafted HTTP request to cause a denial of service. Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H; score 5.5).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: dos

The template first authenticates via POST /api/user_login (using supplied username/password), fetches /admin/view:modules/load_module:users/edit-user:2 to extract the CSRF token, current username, and email via regex, then issues a PATCH /api/user/2 request with first_name set to 600 repeated 'A' characters (plus other fields). It detects the condition by confirming status_code==200, application/json content-type, and reflection of the full oversized payload inside the JSON body.
