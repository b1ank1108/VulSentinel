## Vulnerability
Rukovoditel <= 3.2.1 contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Users Access Groups feature (`/index.php?module=users_groups/users_groups`). Authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary scripts or HTML by submitting a crafted payload in the Name parameter when creating a new group.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (5.4) | CWE-79

Exploitation allows JavaScript execution in the victim's browser, enabling data theft, session hijacking, or application defacement. Remediation requires upgrade to a version higher than 3.2.1.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template first issues a GET to the login page to extract the form_session_token nonce, then POSTs credentials (username/password) to authenticate, followed by a POST to `/index.php?module=users_groups/users_groups&action=save` that submits the group name set to the encoded payload `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. Vulnerability is confirmed when the final response returns status 200, HTML content-type, contains the raw unsanitized payload string, and includes "rukovoditel" markers.
