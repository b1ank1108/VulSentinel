## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-38817 is an improper access control vulnerability affecting Dapr Dashboard versions 0.1.0 through 0.10.0. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) with a CVSS score of 7.5. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive dashboard endpoints that should require authentication, potentially exposing configuration data, component information, and control plane details. This enables attackers to obtain sensitive information about the Dapr deployment, modify data, and execute unauthorized operations against the dashboard interface. The vulnerability requires no authentication (PR:N) and has low attack complexity (AC:L), making it readily exploitable over the network.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects this vulnerability by attempting to access three protected Dapr Dashboard endpoints without authentication:
1. `/components/statestore` - exposes state store component configuration
2. `/overview` - provides dashboard overview information
3. `/controlplane` - reveals control plane details

The detection uses a stop-at-first-match strategy, sending GET requests to these endpoints. A vulnerable instance is identified when:
- The response returns HTTP 200 status
- The response body contains `<title>Dapr Dashboard</title>`, confirming the Dapr Dashboard is present and accessible

Successful detection indicates that authentication controls are missing or improperly implemented, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive dashboard functionality and configuration data.
