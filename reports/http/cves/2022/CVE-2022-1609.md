## Vulnerability

CVE-2022-1609 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in The School Management WordPress plugin (Pro version) affecting all versions prior to 9.9.7. The plugin contains an obfuscated backdoor deliberately injected into its license checking code. This backdoor registers a REST API handler at `/wp-json/am-member/license` that accepts unauthenticated requests and executes arbitrary PHP code passed through POST parameters. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code - Code Injection) with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating maximum severity across network attack vector, low complexity, and no privileges or user interaction required. The EPSS score of 0.93495 (99.818th percentile) indicates this vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: rce

The template detects this vulnerability by sending an unauthenticated POST request to the backdoor REST API endpoint `/wp-json/am-member/license`. The request includes two POST parameters: `blowfish=1` and `blowf=system('{{cmd}}');`, where the `blowf` parameter contains PHP code that will be executed by the backdoor. The template uses a harmless command (`echo CVE-2022-1609 | rev`) that reverses the CVE identifier string. Successful exploitation is confirmed by matching the reversed string `9061-2202-EVC` in the response body, proving that arbitrary system commands were executed on the server. This demonstrates the presence of the backdoor and confirms the ability to achieve remote code execution without any authentication.
