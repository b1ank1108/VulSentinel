## Vulnerability
A directory traversal vulnerability in `plugins/system/cdscriptegrator/libraries/highslide/js/jsloader.php` in the Core Design Scriptegrator plugin 1.4.1 for Joomla! allows remote attackers to read, and possibly include and execute, arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in the `files[]` parameter.

Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure.

Remediation: Upgrade to the latest version to mitigate this vulnerability.

CVSS: 7.5 (CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) | CWE-22

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/plugins/system/cdscriptegrator/libraries/highslide/js/jsloader.php?files[]=/etc/passwd` and verifies success via an AND matcher requiring HTTP 200 status and regex match for `root:.*:0:0:` (confirming `/etc/passwd` contents were returned).
