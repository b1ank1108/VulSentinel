## Vulnerability
Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1 and earlier (including 8.0, 8.0.1, 9.0, 9.0.1) is affected by multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities (CWE-22, CVE-2010-2861) in the administrator console. Remote unauthenticated attackers can read arbitrary files by injecting traversal sequences into the `locale` parameter on CFIDE/administrator/ endpoints (enter.cfm, mappings.cfm, settings.cfm, datasources/index.cfm, j2eepackaging/editarchive.cfm). Successful exploitation leaks sensitive files such as lib/password.properties containing RDS credentials (rdspassword= and encrypted= values). CVSS 2.0: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P). Impact: unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential full system compromise.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=../../../../../../../lib/password.properties%00en` and verifies exploitation by confirming HTTP 200 status plus the simultaneous presence of the strings "rdspassword=" and "encrypted=" in the response body.
