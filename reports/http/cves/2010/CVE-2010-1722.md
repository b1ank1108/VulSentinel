## Vulnerability
Joomla! Component Online Market 2.x (com_market) contains a directory traversal vulnerability in the `controller` parameter to `index.php`. Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via `../` sequences, potentially leading to information disclosure and other impacts.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a GET request with a traversal payload to include `/etc/passwd` (`controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`) under the `com_market` option and verifies success by matching the `root:.*:0:0:` pattern in the HTTP 200 response.
