## Vulnerability
A directory traversal vulnerability in the Abbreviations Manager (com_abbrev) component 1.1 for Joomla! allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a `..` (dot dot) sequence in the `controller` parameter to `index.php`.

CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P (score 7.5). CWE-22.

Impact: Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files and potential remote code execution.

Remediation: Apply all relevant security patches and product upgrades.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template sends a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?option=com_abbrev&controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` and matches for HTTP 200 status code together with the regex `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body.
