## Vulnerability
Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.2 before 4.2.0.CP09 and 4.3 before 4.3.0.CP08 suffers from sensitive information disclosure. Remote attackers can obtain details about deployed web contexts by querying the status servlet with `?full=true`. This is a regression of CVE-2008-3273. CVSS 2.0 score: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/status?full=true` and verifies exposure by matching HTTP 200 status code along with the presence of "JVM", "memory", and "localhost/" strings in the response body, confirming leakage of server status including JVM details and web context information.
