## Vulnerability
A directory traversal vulnerability in the Web TV (com_webtv) component 1.0 for Joomla! allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files and have possibly other unspecified impacts via a `..` (dot dot) sequence in the `controller` parameter to `index.php`.  
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?option=com_webtv&controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` and verifies the vulnerability by checking for HTTP status 200 combined with the regex match `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body (confirming that `/etc/passwd` was successfully read).
