## Vulnerability
Directory traversal vulnerability in the jVideoDirect (com_jvideodirect) component for Joomla! allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a `..` (dot dot) sequence in the `controller` parameter to `index.php`.

Unauthenticated attackers can access sensitive files on the server filesystem.  
CVSS v2: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The nuclei template detects the vulnerability by sending a single GET request with a path traversal payload designed to read the /etc/passwd file:

`GET {{BaseURL}}/index.php?option=com_jvideodirect&controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`

Matchers confirm success if the response status is 200 and the body contains a regex match for `root:.*:0:0:` indicating the file was successfully retrieved and contains typical passwd content.
