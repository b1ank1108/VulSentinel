## Vulnerability
A directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in the Advertising (com_advertising) component 0.25 for Joomla! allows remote unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files and possibly have unspecified other impacts via a `..` (dot dot) sequence in the `controller` parameter to `index.php`.

Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive files (e.g. configuration files or /etc/passwd), potential remote code execution, and full compromise of the Joomla! installation.

CVSS 2.0: 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?option=com_advertising&controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` and verifies success via HTTP 200 status combined with a regex match for `root:.*:0:0:` (confirming /etc/passwd contents were returned).
