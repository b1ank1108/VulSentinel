## Vulnerability
A directory traversal vulnerability in jinventory.php in the JInventory (com_jinventory) component 1.23.02 and possibly other versions before 1.26.03, a module for Joomla!, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the controller parameter to index.php. Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive files. CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N (score 5.0). CWE-22. Remediation: upgrade to a version after 1.26.02.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template sends a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?option=com_jinventory&controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` and verifies exploitation by checking for HTTP 200 and the regex pattern `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body (confirming /etc/passwd was successfully included).
