## Vulnerability
A directory traversal vulnerability in the Dione Form Wizard (aka FDione or com_dioneformwizard) component 1.0.2 for Joomla! allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in the `controller` parameter to `index.php`.

CVSS v2.0 score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P). CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory.

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, leading to unauthorized access and potential data leakage.

Remediation: Upgrade to the latest version of the component.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues an unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?option=com_dioneformwizard&controller=../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` and verifies exploitation success by checking for HTTP status 200 and the regex pattern `root:.*:0:0:` in the response body (indicating /etc/passwd contents were returned).
