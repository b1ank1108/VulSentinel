## Vulnerability
Joomla! Component Realtyna Translator 1.0.15 (com_realtyna) for Joomla! contains a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) via the `controller` parameter in `index.php?option=com_realtyna`. Remote attackers can read arbitrary files by supplying `..` sequences terminated with `%00`.  
CVSS 2.0: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).  
Successful exploitation yields unauthorized access to sensitive files (e.g. configuration, credentials), potential remote code execution, and full website compromise.  
Remediation: upgrade to a patched version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template detects the flaw with a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?option=com_realtyna&controller=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`, matching HTTP 200 status and regex `root:.*:0:0:` to confirm /etc/passwd inclusion.
