## Vulnerability
Apache Axis2, as used in dswsbobje.war in SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise XI 3.2, CA ARCserve D2D r15, and other products, ships with a default password of `axis2` for the `admin` account. This enables remote attackers to log into the Axis2 Web Admin Module and upload a crafted web service to execute arbitrary code. CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C (score 10.0); CWE-255 (Credentials Management Errors).

**Impact**  
Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive information or the ability to modify or delete data.

**Remediation**  
Disable or restrict access to the Axis2 web interface, or apply the necessary patches or updates provided by the vendor.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: auth-bypass

The template performs two raw POST login requests (pitchfork attack) to `/axis2-admin/login` and `/axis2/axis2-admin/login` using the default credentials `admin:axis2`. It confirms successful authentication (and therefore the presence of the default-credential vulnerability) by matching the exact string `<h1>Welcome to Axis2 Web Admin Module !!</h1>` in the response body together with HTTP status 200.
