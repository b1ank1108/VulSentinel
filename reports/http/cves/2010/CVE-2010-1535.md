## Vulnerability
A directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in the TRAVELbook (com_travelbook) component 1.0.1 for Joomla! allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files and possibly have unspecified other impacts via a `..` (dot dot) sequence in the `controller` parameter to `index.php?option=com_travelbook`. CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P (score 7.5). Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive files such as configuration data or system files.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template issues a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?option=com_travelbook&controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` and verifies exploitation via HTTP 200 status combined with the regex matcher `root:.*:0:0:` confirming that /etc/passwd was successfully included and returned in the response body.
