## Vulnerability

Joomla! Component com_janews version 1.0 for Joomla! suffers from a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) enabling Local File Inclusion (LFI). Remote unauthenticated attackers can read arbitrary local files by injecting `..` sequences (with null-byte termination) into the `controller` parameter of `index.php?option=com_janews`.

CVSS v2.0: 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)  
Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive files (e.g. /etc/passwd) with potential escalation to remote code execution.  
Remediation: Upgrade the component to a patched version.

## PoC / Detection

Classification: info-leak

The template detects the flaw with a single unauthenticated GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/index.php?option=com_janews&controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`. Success is confirmed by HTTP 200 status and presence of the regex `root:.*:0:0:` (signature of leaked /etc/passwd contents).
