## Vulnerability
Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in the web server of the Motorola SBV6120E SURFboard Digital Voice Modem running firmware SBV6X2X-1.0.0.5-SCM-02-SHPC. Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via (1) multiple leading slashes ("//"), (2) "../" sequences, or encoded dot-dot sequences in URL requests.  
CVSS v2: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)  
CWE-22 (Path Traversal)  
Impact: Unauthorized file reads (e.g. /etc/passwd), with potential for data leakage or further compromise.  
Remediation: Upgrade to a supported product version.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template detects the vulnerability by issuing a GET request to `{{BaseURL}}/../../etc/passwd` and matching on HTTP status 200 combined with the regex `root:.*:0:0:` to confirm successful path traversal and retrieval of sensitive system file content.
