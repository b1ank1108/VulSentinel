## Vulnerability

Pure-FTPd is vulnerable to CVE-2021-40524 in versions >1.0.23 and <=1.0.50. The flaw is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability stemming from a max_filesize quota enforcement issue. Attackers can upload extremely large files or unlimited numbers of files, leading to resource exhaustion, disk space exhaustion, server hangs, and denial of service.

**CVSS v3.1**: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)  
**CWE**: CWE-434

## PoC / Detection

Classification: dos

The template performs a TCP connection to port 21 (FTP) and sends hex data `00000000` to elicit the service banner. It reads up to 1024 bytes, uses regex to extract the version (`Pure-FTPd ([0-9.]+)`), and applies DSL matchers to confirm the banner contains "Pure-FTPd" and the version satisfies `compare_versions(version, '> 1.0.23 ', '<= 1.0.50')`.
