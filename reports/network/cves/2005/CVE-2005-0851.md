## Vulnerability
FileZilla Server versions prior to 0.9.6 are vulnerable to denial of service when using MODE Z (zlib compression). Remote attackers can cause an infinite loop via certain file uploads or directory listings, leading to server unresponsiveness.  
Impact: Attackers can trigger infinite loops during MODE Z operations, causing FileZilla Server to become completely unresponsive and requiring service restart.  
Remediation: Upgrade FileZilla Server to version 0.9.6 or later that properly handles MODE Z zlib compression operations.  
Classification: CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P (score 5.0), CWE-835, CPE cpe:2.3:a:filezilla-project:filezilla_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

## PoC / Detection
Classification: dos  
The template establishes a TCP connection to port 21, sends hex payload 00000000, reads up to 1024 bytes from the banner, extracts the version with regex `FileZilla Server version ([0-9.]+)`, and matches if the response contains 'FileZilla' AND `compare_versions(version, '< 0.9.6')`. This performs passive version fingerprinting only; the actual DoS requires triggering MODE Z operations (not performed by the template).
