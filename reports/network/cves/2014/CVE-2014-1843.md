## Vulnerability
Titan FTP Server versions prior to 10.40 contain a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) that allows remote unauthenticated attackers to view "Properties" of user folders via path traversal. This enables user enumeration and access to sensitive user information useful for launching further targeted attacks.  
CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N (score 5.0).  
Impact: reconnaissance and information disclosure on the FTP service.  
Remediation: update to version 10.40 build 1829 or later with proper file-path validation.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak

The template performs passive banner-grab detection: opens a TCP connection to port 21, sends hex payload `00000000`, reads up to 1024 bytes of the response, extracts the server version with regex `Titan FTP Server ([0-9.]+)`, then applies DSL matchers `contains(raw, 'Titan') && compare_versions(version, '< 10.40')`.

## References
None provided in the template.
