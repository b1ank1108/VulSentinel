## Vulnerability
vsftpd v2.3.4 contains a malicious backdoor (inserted by an attacker) that enables unauthenticated remote command execution as root. The backdoor activates when the username field in an FTP login request contains the string ":)", spawning a root shell on TCP port 6200.

**Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands with full root privileges on the FTP server.  
**Remediation:** Update to a version of vsftpd later than 2.3.4 (the backdoor is absent from all other releases).  
**CVSS 3.1:** 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) | CWE-78.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template first connects via TCP to port 21 and sends the trigger sequence `USER letmein:)\r\nPASS please\r\n` to activate the backdoor. It then opens a second TCP connection to `{{Host}}:6200`, transmits the command stored in the `cmd` variable (default: `cat /etc/passwd`), and uses a regex matcher on the raw response (`root:.*:0:0:`) to confirm successful arbitrary command execution as root.
