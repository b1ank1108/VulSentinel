## Vulnerability
Pure-FTPd versions prior to 1.0.52 contain a buffer overflow vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds read in the `domlsd()` function within `ls.c`. Remote attackers can trigger this via specially crafted FTP commands, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.

**Impact**  
Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the FTP server.

**Remediation**  
Upgrade to Pure-FTPd 1.0.52 or later.

**CVSS**  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H (score 8.6)  
**CWE**  
CWE-125

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template establishes a TCP connection to port 21, sends a minimal hex payload (`00000000`), and reads up to 1024 bytes of the server banner. It extracts the version with the regex `Pure-FTPd ([0-9.]+)` and confirms the vulnerable range via DSL matchers (`contains(raw, 'Pure-FTPd')` AND `compare_versions(version, '< 1.0.52')`). This is passive banner-based version detection only.
