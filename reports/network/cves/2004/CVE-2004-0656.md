## Vulnerability
Pure-FTPd ≤ 1.0.18 contains a denial-of-service flaw in the accept_client function. When the configured maximum number of connections is reached, the server fails to handle further incoming connections gracefully and may become unresponsive or crash. The issue is triggered remotely over TCP/21 without authentication.

CVSS v2.0: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

## PoC / Detection
Classification: dos

The template opens a TCP connection to port 21, transmits a single null-byte payload (hex `00000000`), reads up to 1024 bytes of the server response, extracts the version with the regex `Pure-FTPd ([0-9.]+)`, and confirms the banner contains `Pure-FTPd` while the parsed version satisfies `<= 1.0.18` via DSL matchers. The probe is non-intrusive and only fingerprints the vulnerable banner; actual exploitation requires flooding the server with concurrent connections.
