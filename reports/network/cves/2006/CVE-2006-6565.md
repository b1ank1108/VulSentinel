## Vulnerability
FileZilla Server versions prior to 0.9.22 are vulnerable to remote denial of service via NULL pointer dereference. Processing wildcard arguments to LIST/NLST commands, malformed PORT commands, or other malformed commands causes a server crash. Authenticated attackers can trigger the flaw over the network. CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P (score 4.0). CWE-476.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: dos  
The template opens a TCP connection to port 21, sends hex data `00000000`, reads up to 1024 bytes of the response banner, checks for the string "FileZilla", and extracts the server version via regex `FileZilla Server version ([0-9.]+)`. It then applies the DSL matcher `compare_versions(version, '< 0.9.22')` to flag vulnerable installations. No exploit commands are sent; detection is purely passive banner-based version checking.
