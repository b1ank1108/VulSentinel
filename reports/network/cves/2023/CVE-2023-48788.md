## Vulnerability
Fortinet Forticlient Endpoint Management Server (FortiClientEMS) contains an improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command (CWE-89). Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands through specially crafted network packets sent to the server.  

CVSS 3.1: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).  
Impact: database compromise, access to sensitive endpoint data, and execution of unauthorized code.  
Remediation: upgrade to 7.2.3 or later (7.2.x series) or 7.0.11 or later (7.0.x series).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template opens a TCP connection to `{{Hostname}}:8013` and transmits a single crafted client-registration packet. The `FCTUID` value inside the `MSG_HEADER` block is injected with `' OR 1=1 --` followed by a large base64-encoded block of system information mimicking a legitimate FortiClient endpoint. The matcher inspects the response body for the presence of the literal string `KA_INTERVAL`.
