## Vulnerability
TitanFTP versions ≤ 1.94.1205 contain a path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in the move-file function. The newPath parameter is improperly validated, allowing an authenticated user to upload a file and then move it to any location on the server filesystem via traversal sequences. This enables arbitrary file placement, overwriting of system files, planting of malicious executables, and full server compromise.  
CVSS 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: state-change

The template establishes a TCP connection to port 21, sends hex payload `00000000`, reads up to 1024 bytes of the banner, extracts the version via regex `TitanFTP ([0-9.]+)`, and matches if the banner contains `TitanFTP` **and** `compare_versions(version, '<= 1.94.1205')` holds. This is a passive fingerprinting check that identifies vulnerable installations without triggering the path-traversal payload.
