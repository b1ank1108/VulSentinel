## Vulnerability

OpenSLP as used in ESXi and the Horizon DaaS appliances has a heap overwrite issue. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the Critical severity range with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of 9.8.

Unauthenticated attackers can exploit the heap overflow in OpenSLP implementation on ESXi and Horizon DaaS appliances to cause denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code on VMware infrastructure servers.

CVSSv3.1: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (CWE-787 out-of-bounds write).

## PoC / Detection
Classification: rce

The template sends two raw TCP hex-encoded SLP v2 packets to port 427. The first packet contains an oversized buffer (repeated 0x79 bytes plus service strings) crafted to trigger the heap overflow. A second query packet follows immediately. The DSL matcher confirms exploitation condition if the response data length is exactly 0 (service unresponsive/crashed).
