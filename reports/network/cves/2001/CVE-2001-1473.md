## Vulnerability
SSH servers supporting the deprecated SSH protocol version 1 (CVE-2001-1473) expose known cryptographic weaknesses (CWE-310). Attackers can potentially decrypt traffic, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, or compromise SSH session integrity.  
CVSS:2.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P (score 7.5).  
Remediation: Upgrade to SSH 2.4 or later.

## PoC / Detection
Classification: info-leak  
The template opens a TCP connection to port 22 and matches the word "SSH-1" in the service banner to detect servers advertising support for the vulnerable SSHv1 protocol.
